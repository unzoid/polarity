///    before, [`COMMON_FRAMES`] for a common picture shape, and
///    [`CROP_HISTORY`] for an odd one. Opposite bars must be even, as
///    letterboxing is; a dark scene lit on one side isn't a bar. The picture

///    crisp on both sides need fewer frames: 1 for a common shape, 2 for
///    any other. A wrong crop costs one frame, since it's undone as soon as
///    picture shows in the bar.
///  * Bars the film animates itself (they open or close over a shot): once
///    3 frames in a row have crisp edges moving the same way, each frame's

# Licensing

Polarity plays HTTP links, YouTube ids and, on desktop and Android, torrent streams the user's own add-ons return
(built-in engine, `crates/torrent`). It ships no third-party stream add-ons; add-ons are chosen and
installed by the user.

| Part | Licence | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Polarity itself | MIT | `LICENSE` |
| OpenDyslexic font | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | `src/assets/fonts/OFL.txt`, `src-tauri/fonts/OFL.txt` |
| App fonts: Instrument Sans, Hanken Grotesk, Onest, Mona Sans (Settings → Appearance → Font) | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans`, `/hanken-grotesk`, `/onest`, `/mona-sans` in `package.json`; each package's `LICENSE` has the font's copyright and the licence text, copied unchanged to `src-tauri/fonts/<Font>-OFL.txt` (the shell builds without `node_modules`); desktop builds ship it as `licenses/<font>/OFL.txt` (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` resources). Update the copy when a font package's licence changes |
| Avatars (DiceBear) | Designs CC0, code MIT | `@dicebear/*` in `package.json` |
| Flag emoji on Windows (Twemoji Country Flags font) | Flag artwork from Twemoji, CC BY 4.0; the polyfill that loads it, MIT (TalkJS) | `country-flag-emoji-polyfill` in `package.json` (its `LICENSE.md` has both texts); credited in Settings → About → Credits. Only loaded where the system draws no flags (`src/main.tsx`) |
| mpv (desktop player) | GPL-2.0-or-later | Windows: `licenses/mpv/` in the app (`LICENSE.GPL.txt`, `COPYRIGHT.txt`, FFmpeg's texts and `BUNDLED.txt`, listing every library in `mpv.exe` at its commit); `mpv.exe` is built in CI by `scripts/windows-mpv.sh` from shinchiro's mpv-winbuild-cmake with every library pinned in `scripts/windows-mpv.lock`, and every Windows release attaches the exact sources as `Sources-Polarity-<version>-Windows-x64-mpv.tar` (up to 0.18.0 `Polarity_<version>_x64_mpv-sources.tar`) (`scripts/fetch-mpv.ts`, `scripts/release.ts` or the Release workflow); macOS: `licenses/` in the app, with `BUNDLED.txt` naming each bundled library's build (`scripts/bundle-libmpv.ts`); the exact source of each, with Homebrew's build recipes, is attached to every macOS release as `Sources-Polarity-<version>-macOS-arm64-mpv.tar` (up to 0.18.0 `Polarity_<version>_aarch64_mpv-sources.tar`) (`scripts/macSources.ts`, run by `scripts/release-mac.ts` or the Release workflow) |
| FFmpeg (inside mpv) | GPL, as built into mpv | With mpv's, above |
| libmpv and FFmpeg (Android player) | GPL-3.0-or-later as built (FFmpeg `--enable-gpl --enable-version3`), with the libraries they link (mbedTLS, dav1d, libass, libplacebo, …) | In the APK: `assets/licenses/mpv/` (mpv's and FFmpeg's licence texts, `BUNDLED.txt` naming each library's version; the NDK's `libc++_shared.so`, Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception, which libmpv links, with its notices in `libc++-NOTICE.txt`). Sources: `polarity-android-mpv-sources.tar.xz`, made by `scripts/android-mpv.sh` with the build (CI artifact `android-mpv-sources` next to the APK), with every source, mpv-android's build scripts and `SOURCES.txt`; it is published with every release that carries an APK, as `Sources-Polarity-<version>-Android-mpv.tar.xz` |
| libmpv and FFmpeg (iOS player) | LGPL-2.1-or-later as built (mpv `-Dgpl=false`; FFmpeg without `--enable-gpl` or `--enable-version3`, the build stops otherwise), with libplacebo and FriBidi (LGPL-2.1-or-later), dav1d (BSD-2-Clause), libass (ISC), FreeType (FTL) and HarfBuzz (MIT) | Linked dynamically, as the LGPL asks: each LGPL library is a dynamic framework of its own, embedded in the app (`Libmpv`, `Libavcodec`, `Libavfilter`, `Libavformat`, `Libavutil`, `Libswresample`, `Libswscale`, `Libplacebo`, `Libfribidi`), so each can be replaced with one built from the sources; the app loads libmpv at run time and it loads the rest. dav1d, libass, FreeType and HarfBuzz, whose licences allow it, are linked statically into the library that uses them. In the app: `licenses/mpv/` (each library's licence text, `BUNDLED.txt` naming its version). Sources: `polarity-ios-mpv-sources.tar.xz`, made by `scripts/ios-mpv.sh` with the build (CI artifact `ios-mpv-sources` next to the IPA), with every source, the script and `SOURCES.txt` (versions and configure options); it is published with every release that carries an iOS build, as `Sources-Polarity-<version>-iOS-mpv.tar.xz` |
| Torrent engine (librqbit, desktop and Android) | Apache-2.0; with it rustls and aws-lc-rs (ISC, Apache-2.0, and aws-lc's OpenSSL- and BSD-licensed parts) | `Cargo.lock`; each crate's licence in its package |
| Notifications (#209): `zbus` (Linux), `windows` (Windows toasts) | MIT (zbus); MIT or Apache-2.0 (windows) | `Cargo.lock`; both were already in the build through other crates and are now direct dependencies of `src-tauri` |
| Notifications on Android: AndroidX WorkManager (`androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx`) | Apache-2.0 | `src-tauri/gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts`; in the APK with the other AndroidX libraries |
| libc (all but Windows) and windows-sys (Windows): free disk space on the Downloads page (`src-tauri/src/disk.rs`) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | Direct dependencies of `src-tauri`, already built in through other crates; `Cargo.lock`, each crate's licence in its package |
| npm and Rust dependencies | Each package's own | `bun.lock`, `Cargo.lock` |

| Simkl's monochrome mark, `src/assets/simkl-mark.svg` (#319) | A trademark of Simkl.

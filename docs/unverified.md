# What could not be checked on the dev machine

The work on this branch was done on a Linux VM with no display, no WebKitGTK and no
mpv. `tsc`, `vite build`, `bun run test` and `cargo test` for the five core crates
(`polar-addon`, `polar-anime`, `polar-index`, `polar-library`, `polar-player`) run there; `src-tauri` does not build there. The
screens were looked at only in a headless Chromium against a fake shell (below,
T-051), never in the app's own window. This file lists what still needs a person
with the app, and how to check each item.

## Built by reading only (`src-tauri`)

`src-tauri` was checked with `rustfmt`, by reading and, from R4 on, with `cargo clippy
--all-targets` against stub system libraries (it type-checks; it can't link or run here).
Since R4's last steps it is also type-checked for Windows (`--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, zig as the C
compiler, a stub resource compiler), so the `cfg(windows)` code (mpv as its own process, the named pipe) compiles;
the MSVC target the releases use and the macOS code (`cfg(target_os = "macos")`, `mpv_view.m`) were never compiled.
`cargo build` / `bun tauri dev` on a desktop is the first check for every item below.
Its tests (`cargo test -p polar`) were therefore never run here: since T-035 CI runs them on Linux,
Windows and macOS on every push, including the downloads resume tests (`downloads.rs`, a local
server answering ranges, whole files, the wrong part, 416, 403/503) and the error-code contract
(`contract.rs` against `contract/error-codes.json`). CI has never run: it first runs from the owner's push
(after the desktop test and the history rewrite, I-013), so until then they are unseen.

## CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, T-054)

CI has never run: nothing here publishes to GitHub. Checked on the dev machine instead:

- Every step of the `frontend` job: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run test` (unit, SQL and
  the DOM component tests in `tests/dom`), `bun run build`.
- `cargo fmt --all --check`; `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings` for the five core
  crates, for `src-tauri` on Linux (stub system libraries) and for `src-tauri` on
  `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (not the MSVC target the Windows runner uses).
- Each action's pinned commit is the commit of the tag in its comment (`git ls-remote`, 2026-11-05):
  checkout v7.0.1, setup-bun v2.2.0, rust-cache v2.9.3, cache v6.1.0, rust-toolchain `stable`.
- The Linux packages the `rust` job installs exist under those names in Ubuntu 24.04, which
  `ubuntu-latest` is (runner-images README), and in 26.04 (packages.ubuntu.com).
- The `e2e-web` job's tests (T-039, `bun run e2e`): all 12 pass in the desktop, phone and TV
  projects, three runs in a row, but in the Chromium already unpacked here (`POLAR_E2E_CHROMIUM`),
  not Playwright's own build: `playwright install` can't download here. upload-artifact v7.0.2's
  pinned commit is that tag's (GitHub API, 2026-11-05).

Not checked: the workflow file against GitHub's schema (`actionlint` could not be run here:
`actionlint .github/workflows/ci.yml` on a desktop does it), and anything about the runners
themselves: WebKitGTK linking on Ubuntu, `cargo test -p polar` anywhere, the bundled-mpv fetch and
cache on Windows, macOS, and the `desktop-webkit` end-to-end project (WebKit was never run here;
the player test in it needs WebKit to play a WAV, which Playwright's `--with-deps` should give it).
The first push shows these; a failing job prints its step and keeps the Playwright report.

## App smoke test (`.github/workflows/e2e-app.yml`, T-040)

It can't run here (the app can't link). Its first CI runs failed (#46): on Linux the script read
elements under a wrong W3C key, and on Windows the elevated runner's WebView2 dropped the driver's
DevTools port (fixed through `src-tauri/src/automation.rs`, see [testing.md](testing.md)); both
fixes are confirmed only by the next run on `master`. Checked here: the script
type-checks (`bunx tsc -p e2e`), the workflow parses as YAML, its actions are pinned to the same
commits as `ci.yml`, tauri-driver 2.1.0 is the newest release on crates.io and msedgedriver-tool is
pinned to its newest commit (GitHub API, 2026-11-05). Unknown until it runs: whether WebKitWebDriver
under `xvfb-run` and msedgedriver from that tool match the runners' web views, whether the app
inherits the `XDG_*` folders through tauri-driver on Linux, and the selectors against the real
first screen. To try it on a Linux desktop: `cargo install tauri-driver --locked`, install
`webkit2gtk-driver`, `bunx tauri build --debug --no-bundle`, `bun run e2e:app`; it prints each step
and the one it stopped at. In GitHub: Actions → App end to end → Run workflow.

What CI checks, layer by layer: [testing.md](testing.md).

## Android build (`src-tauri/gen/android`, CI job `android`, T-042)

Never built: the Android SDK and NDK can't be downloaded here (Google's hosts are refused). The
project was generated with `tauri android init` against stand-in SDK, NDK and Java folders, so
the files are Tauri's template for this app, with Polarity's launcher icon (`tauri icon`) on a dark
background in place of Tauri's logo. Checked here: `src-tauri` type-checks and passes clippy for
`aarch64-linux-android` (zig standing in for the NDK's compiler; nothing linked), the updater and
process permissions now sit in `capabilities/desktop.json`, which mobile builds skip, and gilrs is
left out of phone builds (the Gamepad API still sees controllers). Unknown until the job runs:
Gradle 9.6 and the Android Gradle plugin 9.3 on Java 21, whether the runner image has the SDK
platform the project compiles against (the job installs it), and the APK itself. To try it on a
desktop with Android Studio: `bun run tauri android dev` with an emulator running, or download the
`android-debug-apk` artifact from a CI run and `adb install` it. On a phone, look for: the app opens
on the home screen, the phone layout and bottom tab bar, a title plays in `<video>` where the phone
can decode it.

## Android Back, keyboard, downloads, emulator run (T-043)

Built without running on Android: Back (button, gesture, a remote's Back) reaches the page through Tauri's
`onBackButtonPress` (`lib/platform/back.ts`), which takes Back over from the system; the page presses Escape where
focus is (`lib/ui/systemBack.ts`), so the top layer closes, then the player or pushed page; on a tab's own page Back
goes Home, and on Home the app goes to the background as Android's own Back does (`polarDevice.leave` in `MainActivity.kt`; `exit` only if that bridge is missing).
A focused text field loses focus first. Tested here: the decision (`tests/systemBack.test.ts`) and the Escape it
sends (`tests/dom/systemBack.test.ts`). Not known: whether the WebView also delivers KEYCODE_BACK to the page as a
key (it would go back twice), and the account screens before sign-in, which register no handler (the system's
default: the web view's history, else the app closes).
On-screen keyboard: from Android 15, edge to edge, the window no longer shrinks for it, so `MainActivity.kt` pads
the content view by the keyboard's height less the navigation bar's (never compiled here), and
`lib/ui/keyboard.ts` scrolls the focused field into view on each resize. Look for: a search field at the top and
the account forms near the bottom stay above the keyboard, with no gap or double padding.
Downloads stay in `app_data_dir/downloads` (app-private); "Show in Folder" is hidden off desktop.
Emulator: `e2e-app.yml` job `android` (nightly, `master`) builds the x86_64 debug APK and runs `e2e/android/smoke.sh`
in an API 35 emulator: start, 30 s alive, Back, no crash; logcat and screenshots as an artifact. Not run yet.
The Playwright suite isn't pointed at the app (it would need a WebDriver into the
WebView, chromedriver through adb); the screenshots are the check of what it shows.

Back gesture that follows the finger (#483: `MainActivity.kt` `predictiveBack`, `onPredictiveBack` in
`lib/platform/back.ts`, `lib/ui/pageDrag.ts`). On Android 14 and later, while the page hears it, the activity sends
the gesture's steps into the page's main frame as `polar-back` events, and every Back, a press too, goes that way
instead of Tauri's back button event. Tested here: the steps moving the page and going back
(`tests/dom/predictiveBack.test.ts`); the Kotlin compiled with Gradle. Not run in an emulator or on a phone yet. To
check on an Android 14 or later phone with gesture navigation:
1. On a title page, swipe in slowly from the left edge and hold: the title page moves right with the finger and the
   page it came from shows under it. Move back: it follows. Let go early (or move back to the edge): it slides back
   and stays. Swipe further and let go: you're on the page under it, with no second animation. Same from the right
   edge.
2. With Sources (or any sheet) open, the gesture closes the sheet and the page doesn't move; in the player it
   leaves the player as before; on a section's own page Back goes Home, on Home the app goes to the background.
3. With 3-button navigation, and on Android 13 or older, Back goes back one step at a time as before.
4. Android TV: the remote's Back goes back as before.

## Android TV (same APK, T-047)

Written by reading only: the manifest's banner (`res/drawable-xhdpi/banner.png`, 320x180, the icon and
"Polarity" in Open Sans Bold) and touch screen not required, and `MainActivity.kt` adding a `polarDevice`
JavaScript interface before the first page loads, answering `isTv()` from `UiModeManager` (TV mode type) or the
`android.software.leanback` feature. The Kotlin was never compiled here. The front end's side is tested
(`detectTvDevice`, `startsInTvMode`). To check, in Android Studio start an Android TV emulator (API 34, 1080p) and
`adb install` the `android-debug-apk` artifact (x86_64). Look for: the banner in the launcher's apps row; the app
opening fullscreen in TV mode; the D-pad moving focus; Back closing the top layer, on the home screen opening the TV menu and, with the menu open there, leaving
the app; leaving TV mode from the TV menu lasting until the app is closed, and TV mode back at the next start. On
a phone, TV mode must stay off unless chosen. Fire TV: `UiModeManager` reports TV there too (untested).

## Android player: libmpv (T-044)

Never built or run here (no Android SDK or NDK). Type-checked with clippy for `aarch64-linux-android`; the
certificate bundle and the MediaCodec mapping are tested (`polar-player`: `certs`, `tune`); the build script's
source archive and `SOURCES.txt` steps were tried on a stand-in folder, its build steps weren't.
CI job `android` builds libmpv and FFmpeg with `scripts/android-mpv.sh` (mpv-android's build scripts, pinned
versions: each git source checked against its commit, each archive against its SHA-256; about an hour the first
time, then cached) and keeps `android-mpv-sources` (the sources archive) next to
the APK; the emulator smoke test fails if the APK carries libmpv and the app hasn't loaded it.
What to look for on a phone or the emulator, with the `android-debug-apk` artifact: the loading screen says
"Player: mpv"; an MKV with HEVC video and AC3 or DTS audio plays with picture and sound; ASS and PGS subtitles show;
the page's controls draw over the picture and the picture fills the screen behind them in both orientations;
Home and back to the app: the picture comes back (the surface is given back to mpv) and playback goes on;
an HTTPS stream plays (mbedTLS reads `cacert.pem`, made from `/system/etc/security/cacerts`); subtitles use
Roboto; hardware decoding (Settings → Advanced) on and off both play; autocrop (MediaCodec copied back) works;
a TV box with 2 GB of memory plays a 4K file (the cache is 64 MiB there). Not built: Picture in picture,
background audio, the media session (lock screen controls).
The same job builds an unsigned release APK and app bundle (`android-release-unsigned`), minified by R8:
`proguard-rules.pro` keeps `MpvSurface`'s native methods and `polarDevice`; check that a release build, signed with
any key for testing, starts and plays like the debug one.

## iOS build and player (#29)

Never built or run here (no Mac, no Xcode). The Rust side is type-checked with clippy for `aarch64-apple-ios`
(`src/ios/*.m` swapped for an empty file there, so the Objective-C is only read, not compiled); the macOS
view shares its libmpv loading and frame reading with it (`src/apple/libmpv.h`), so the macOS build checks
that part. CI job `ios` builds libmpv and FFmpeg with `scripts/ios-mpv.sh` (LGPL, pinned versions, cached
after the first run), generates the Xcode project, builds an unsigned IPA (`ios-unsigned-ipa`) and keeps
`ios-mpv-sources` next to it.
Checked in CI (job "iOS build (unsigned)", about 16 minutes from an empty cache): the Objective-C and the
script compile, and the IPA (37 MB unpacked) holds the nine frameworks in `Payload/Polarity.app/Frameworks`
(Libmpv, Libavcodec, Libavfilter, Libavformat, Libavutil, Libswresample, Libswscale, Libplacebo,
Libfribidi) and the licence texts under `assets/licenses/mpv` (FFmpeg's LGPL-2.1, libass, FreeType,
HarfBuzz, libplacebo, …); `ios-mpv-sources` is 45 MB. The app has never been started, on a device or in the
simulator.
What to look for on an iPhone and an iPad, with the IPA signed for testing (any developer account, or a
sideloading tool): the app starts with its own icon; the phone layout on an iPhone, the tablet layout on an
iPad, in both orientations, clear of the notch and the home indicator; the loading screen says "Player: mpv";
an MKV with HEVC video and AC3 or DTS audio plays with picture and sound (also with the silent switch on);
ASS and PGS subtitles show; the page's controls draw over the picture and it fills the screen behind them;
rotating while playing keeps the picture right; Home and back: the picture comes back and playback goes on
(drawing stops in the background; audio may stop with it: background audio isn't built); an HTTPS stream
plays (Secure Transport, the system's certificates); hardware decoding (Settings → Advanced) on and off both
play; autocrop zooms past the bars (our detector on every frame; no cropdetect in this build) and Settings →
Advanced has no "Check every frame for black bars"; a downloaded file plays offline and its folder is not in
an iCloud backup (Settings → Apple Account → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups lists the app's size without
it); the IPA (a zip) holds `licenses/mpv/` with each library's licence and `BUNDLED.txt` in the app.
Not built: Picture in picture, background audio, lock screen controls, AirPlay on iOS (#19 is macOS), signing
and TestFlight (the owner's Apple developer account).

## iOS: five tabs, no More (#449)

With Library a fifth section and Search a sixth tab (#174), an iPhone's tab bar put iOS's own More tab in
their place: a list with an Edit button, and pages under it inside a navigation controller of its own, which
drew a "Library" bar with a round Back above the app's header (also over the player) and took the back swipe
out to the list. Now `native_tabs` carries the sections alone, five at most (`MAX_NATIVE_TABS` in
`lib/navTabs.ts`), and `ios/tabs.m` has no search tab. Checked here: unit tests and the phone e2e with an
iPhone's user agent (the tabs sent, the top bar's buttons, the edge swipe back to the Library). On an iPhone:
1. Five tabs (four with Anime off), no More, with and without Settings → Browsing → Show the Calendar.
2. Search and, when it's on, the Calendar are buttons in the top bar next to the profile; each opens its page.
3. Library → a title → the swipe in from the left edge: back on the Library, never a list of tabs.
4. No iOS navigation bar (a title and a round Back) above the app's header on any page, nor over the player
   started from the Library.
5. A title opened from the Library fills the whole screen (#466 may share this cause).

## iOS player and layouts (#172)

The first runs (simulator and an iPhone) showed a solid blue picture with sound, the status bar over the
video, the bottom controls under the home indicator and a player Back that did nothing. Changed, none of it
run on iOS here:
- Blue picture: mpv draws with OpenGL ES on iOS, which can't map VideoToolbox's 10-bit frames (p010; HEVC
  Main 10 and HDR files), and the picture stays one blue colour; mpv's own tracker has the same report for
  iOS. mpv now asks VideoToolbox for 8-bit NV12 (`--hwdec-image-format=nv12`, `polar_player::tune::IOS_ARGS`),
  which it maps. A frame mpv can't draw now shows black, never an old buffer. Not known: whether the file the
  user tried was 10-bit; if an 8-bit file was blue too, the cause is elsewhere (step 1 below tells the two
  apart).
- Player Back: the window's fullscreen query, refused on phones, held it up; fixed for Android and iOS
  alike in #164 (`lib/platform/window.ts`), after the build that was tried.
- Status bar and home indicator: hidden and fading while the player is open (`ios/system_bars.m`, through
  Tauri's root view controller), back when it closes.
- Safe areas: the player's bars, title, notices, Up Next, Skip and the options' close button keep clear of
  the insets on phones and tablets (e2e with an iPhone's insets, upright and sideways, and a tablet's).
- iOS Back: a swipe in from the left edge (iOS's own edge recognizer, `ios/back.m`) closes what's open, then
  leaves the player; on a pushed page with nothing over it the page follows the finger (#451, below); at a
  tab's own page the edge is the page's (Android's Back goes Home, then leaves the app).
- iPad: the tablet layout in every window, Slide Over and narrow Split View included; there (under 600 px
  wide) the player takes the phone's compact controls. Seen as screenshots at iPad sizes in a desktop
  browser with an iPad user agent, not on an iPad.

To check on an iPhone (notched, iOS 17 or later) and an iPad:
1. Play an 8-bit H.264 file and a 10-bit HEVC (or HDR) one: both with a picture in the right colours, in
   the simulator and on the device; Settings → Advanced → hardware decoding off plays too.
2. While playing, landscape and portrait: no status bar; the home indicator fades after a few seconds and
   comes back on a touch; every control (Back, title, mute, Fit/Fill, scrubber, Speed, Subtitles & Audio,
   Sources, Skip, Up Next) visible and tappable clear of the Dynamic Island and the home indicator. Closing
   the player brings the status bar back.
3. The player's Back button leaves the player; a swipe in from the left edge does too, closes an open sheet
   or menu first, leaves a title page (steps 24 to 26), and does nothing on a tab's own page; a vertical
   scroll that starts at the edge still scrolls.
4. iPad, portrait and landscape, full screen, Split View (half, a third) and Slide Over, Stage Manager
   windows resized: the tablet layout; under 600 px wide the player shows glyph-only actions and the title
   beside Back. With a keyboard and a trackpad: Escape is Back, the shortcuts work, hover shows on cards.

## The space under the top bar on phones (#450)

On a phone a page's title (Series, Movies, Library, Calendar, Anime without its carousel, a playlist) now
starts 0.5rem under the top bar; before, the desktop's 1.75rem plus the heading's default margin left about
48 px of nothing there. Home's featured card already sat right under it. The phone e2e measures the gap on
Home, Series and Library, with and without a notch's inset, and that the bar's row starts where the
status bar ends. Only the web layout runs here. On an iPhone (with #449's change, so no More tab):
- Home, Series, Library: the logo sits just under the status bar, and the page's title or card just under
  the logo's row, with no band of empty space above or below the bar.
- If the bar itself sits lower than the status bar's height, that space comes from the safe area iOS
  reports to the web view (the native side), not from the page: note how much and on which pages.

## iOS green tint (#416)

An iPhone showed video with green and purple patches. Its log (`video: decoder …; decoded …; drawn …`
lines, `polar_player::video_path`) showed the colour tags right throughout, and the picture right once
mpv, after a trip to the home screen, had fallen back from `videotoolbox` (frames drawn straight from
VideoToolbox through OpenGL ES) to `videotoolbox-copy` and then to software decoding. So the fault is in
the zero-copy path between VideoToolbox and mpv's OpenGL ES output; reading mpv's iOS interop
(`hwdec_ios_gl.m`, NV12's planes as LUMINANCE / LUMINANCE_ALPHA textures) and its renderer didn't show
where. What changed:
- iOS decodes with `videotoolbox-copy` (`Tune::ios_hwdec`): VideoToolbox still decodes, its frames are
  copied to memory and drawn as software-decoded ones are. Hardware decoding off is still `no`.
- After the app comes back to the foreground, if VideoToolbox was decoding before and mpv has fallen back
  to software since, hardware decoding is turned off and on again (`player::hardware_decoding_back`), so
  the rest of the video isn't decoded in software.

Nothing here runs iOS. `scripts/colour-bars.sh <dir>` makes SMPTE colour-bar clips (H.264 8-bit, HEVC
10-bit, HEVC 10-bit PQ, AV1) and `bars.png`, how they should look. To check on an iPhone:
- Play each clip and a real episode: no cast on the grey and white bars, colours as in `bars.png` (the PQ
  clip dimmer, but not tinted). polar.log's `video:` lines should say `decoder videotoolbox-copy`.
- During playback, go to the home screen for a few seconds and come back: the picture stays right, and
  within a few seconds the log has a new `video:` line back on `videotoolbox-copy` (not `software`).
- A 4K HEVC episode plays without dropped frames (the copy costs some battery; the log's `video:` lines
  and the phone's warmth are worth noting).

## iOS tab bar (#174)

The sections (Home, Series, Movies, Anime, Library: five at most) are iOS's own tab bar: a
`UITabBarController` becomes the window's root and Tauri's view controller, the web view with the video
behind it, moves into the current tab (`ios/tabs.m`). The web app sends the tabs, the current one and
whether the bar shows (`native_tabs`); a tab the user picks comes back as `native://tab` and opens that
section, the current one picked again goes back to its top. The web-drawn tabs hide. Search and the Calendar
(when it's on) are buttons in the top bar next to the profile, so iOS never adds its own More tab (#449). CI builds with Xcode
26 or later, so iOS 26 draws the bar in Liquid Glass; iOS 17 to 25 get the classic bar; an iPad on iOS 18
or later gets the tab bar that opens into a sidebar. Only the web side ran here (unit tests, the Rust for
iOS type-checked); the Objective-C was written from Apple's documentation and is compiled only by CI.

To check on an iPhone and an iPad on iOS 26, and an iPhone on iOS 17 or 18:
1. The tab bar shows the sections with their icons; the current one is marked; tapping one opens it;
   tapping the current one on a title page goes back to the section's top. Back (the edge swipe), a title
   opened from search and joining a watch party move the marked tab with them; search typed from a section
   keeps that section marked.
2. iOS 26: the floating glass bar; content scrolls under it and the last row of a page clears it. Whether it
   shrinks while scrolling: the pages scroll inside the web view, not the web view itself, so probably not.
3. Older iOS: the classic bar, the last row clears it.
4. The bar hides while the player, Settings or a sheet is open and comes back when they close; the player's
   bottom controls sit by the home indicator, not above an empty space where the bar was (iOS 17 most of
   all).
5. Settings → Browsing → Show the Calendar: no sixth tab; a Calendar button appears in the top bar next to
   Search and opens the Calendar. No More tab on any iPhone, upright or sideways (#449).
6. iPad: the bar at the top, its sidebar button opens the sidebar with the same tabs; Split View, Slide Over
   and Stage Manager sizes; the web top bar (logo, search, profile) doesn't sit under the tab bar.
7. VoiceOver reads the tabs and the current one; Larger Text grows the labels; Reduce Transparency turns the
   glass solid.
8. Status bar: light text over the dark app; hidden in the player, back after (`ios/system_bars.m` now goes
   through the tab bar controller).

Alerts and the share sheet (`ios/dialogs.m`, `lib/platform/nativeDialogs.ts`), the same way unrun:
9. Delete a playlist (Library) and a finished download: an action sheet with a red Delete and Cancel, from
   the bottom on an iPhone and pointing at the bin on an iPad; tapping outside on an iPad deletes nothing.
10. Sign out with changes not yet synced (offline): an alert with Try Again, Sign Out Anyway (red) and
    Cancel; Try Again still offline asks again.
11. In a watch party, Share Invite: the share sheet with the invite text (Copy among its actions); on an
    iPad it points at the button.

A title's options and the dropdowns as iOS's own menu (`components/CardMenu.tsx`, `components/Dropdown.tsx`,
`lib/platform/longPress.ts`, the `menu` kind in `ios/dialogs.m`): a finger held still on a card for half a
second sends the contextmenu a right-click would (WebKit on iOS sends none). On iOS 17.4 and later the menu is
a UIMenu opened by `performPrimaryAction` from an invisible button laid over the card or the dropdown; if it
doesn't show within 0.6 s, or before iOS 17.4, an action sheet comes instead. Only the touch handling ran
(unit tests):
12. Hold a card on Home, in Library and in Continue Watching: after about half a second a menu opens at the
    finger with the title and the same choices as the desktop's right-click menu, in sections; Remove from
    Library and Remove from Continue Watching are red; Playlists opens a submenu with the playlists ticked
    and New Playlist. Lifting the finger doesn't also open the title. Picking does what it says (check
    Library); tapping outside closes it and the next long press still works.
13. Scrolling a row or the page from a card, and tapping a card, open nothing; a held finger on anything
    that isn't a title (a button, the top bar) does what it did before. No text selection, magnifier or
    link preview appears under the finger.
14. Dropdowns (Library's Show and Sort by, Anime's filters, a settings row, the season picker): a menu under
    the dropdown with the current choice ticked; picking one changes the page.
15. On iOS 17.0 to 17.3 (or if the menu never shows, after 0.6 s): an action sheet instead, the current
    choice with a tick after it, Playlists as a second sheet, and Cancel.
16. The profile avatar (top bar): a menu with the other profiles, Manage Profiles, Join Watch Party, Calendar
    (while it isn't a tab), Settings, Account and Sign Out (Sign In for a guest), each doing what it says.
17. VoiceOver reads the menus; the invisible button itself isn't announced.
18. In the player, Speed: a menu over the button with the speeds, the current one ticked; picking one changes
    the speed and the controls stay up while the menu is open. Subtitles & Audio: Audio and Subtitles as
    submenus with the playing tracks ticked, and Subtitle Settings, which opens the full-screen picker with
    the subtitle settings and the preview. Picking a track switches to it. Sources and Episodes keep the
    full-screen picker.

The back button and the sheets' detents (`ios/tabs.m`, `ios/back.m`, `native_back`,
`components/NativeBack.tsx`, `components/Sheet.tsx`). The detents ran in the phone e2e with an iPhone's user
agent (Chromium); the button only as unit tests, its Objective-C compiled only by CI:
19. Search (#449): the magnifier in the top bar, left of the profile, on every page with the top bar. On an
    iPhone it opens the search page (the field focused, the keyboard up); typing shows results; Back (the
    edge swipe) leaves it; tapping the magnifier on the page focuses the field again. On an iPad the field
    opens in the top bar. No search tab in the bar.
20. On a title page (and any page opened from another): Back at the top left is the system's button, glass
    on iOS 26, a chevron before, standing exactly where the web Back was (no second chevron under it, the
    logo beside it not covered). A tap goes back one page. A long press lists the pages behind, nearest
    first, by name (the title's name, Movies, Saved, ...); picking one goes back to it.
21. The button goes away while a sheet (Sources), a menu, Settings or the player is open and comes back
    after; it isn't there on a section's top page; an alert or the share sheet draws over it.
22. Settings on an iPhone: in a section, the back button top left is the system's; a tap goes to the list
    of sections; on the list it's gone. On an iPad (Settings as a panel) none shows.
23. Sheets on an iPhone (Sources, a download's sheet, Anime's Filters, release notes): they open at half the
    screen; dragging the header up rests them nearly full height, down from there rests at half or closes
    when let go past it; a flick goes as far as it was thrown; pushing the list up at half height brings
    the sheet up first; tapping the grabber toggles the two heights; VoiceOver reads the grabber as Expand
    or Collapse. Turning the phone keeps the sheet at its height. An iPad keeps the side sheet.

Back on every page and the swipe that follows the finger (#451: `ios/back.m`, `native_back.rs`,
`lib/platform/backSwipe.ts`, `lib/ui/pageDrag.ts`). The page's move ran in the phone e2e with an iPhone's user
agent and the swipe's steps sent as the shell sends them; iOS's recognizer and the button's new place only
compiled by CI:
24. Every page that can go back (a title page from any section, a Library collection, a playlist, Search's
    results, an anime's page, Settings' sections) shows the system's Back top left, with the logo beside it;
    before, the logo moved right and no button showed (the tab bar's view covered it).
25. On a title page, put a finger on the left edge and move it slowly right: the title page moves with it,
    with a shadow on its left edge, and the page it came from shows under it, coming in from a little to the
    left and brightening. Move back left: it follows. Let go before half the width: the title page slides
    back and stays. Let go past half, or flick right from anywhere: it slides out and the page under it is
    the page, where it was scrolled, with no second animation. Flicking back left before letting go cancels.
26. A row that starts at the left edge (Home's shelves) scrolls sideways from the edge on a section's top
    page; on a title page the same touch is Back. With a sheet or menu open, the swipe closes it and the page
    doesn't move; in the player it leaves the player as before. A vertical scroll near the edge still scrolls.

## macOS release: sources of the bundled libraries

`scripts/macSources.ts` was tested only against a stand-in `brew` (`tests/macSources.test.ts`); Homebrew itself
never ran here. To check, on the Mac that makes releases, with `brew install mpv` up to date:
1. `bun scripts/bundle-libmpv.ts`, then `bun -e 'import { packMacSources } from "./scripts/macSources"; packMacSources("src-tauri/vendor/libmpv/formulae.json", "mpv-sources.tar", "mpv-sources-work")'`.
2. `tar -tf mpv-sources.tar` lists `SOURCES.txt`, one `recipes/<formula>.rb` per keg in `formulae.json`, and under
   `sources/` a source archive for each (plus resources and patches some formulae use, e.g. a `.patch` or `.diff`).
3. `SOURCES.txt`'s versions match `BUNDLED.txt`'s. If Homebrew has a newer version of any of them, step 1 stops
   and says which: `brew upgrade`, then build again.
4. A formula built with Rust or Go fetches its crates or modules while building, which `brew fetch` doesn't
   download: if `formulae.json` lists one, say so (those need adding by hand).

## Saving in the background (R4, H8/M4)

`polar.json` is now written by a background thread about a second after a change,
instead of by each command before it returns. The writer is tested in
`crates/library`; its wiring in `src-tauri` is read-only here.

1. Change a setting, add something to the library, play a few minutes; quit normally
   and start again: all of it is there. `polar.json` is one line now, with `"version":1`.
2. Same, but kill the process (Task Manager / `kill -9`) within a second of a change:
   that last change may be lost, nothing older, and the file still opens.
3. Install an update through the in-app updater right after a change: the relaunch
   may skip the exit hook that flushes; check the change survived (if not, the
   updater path needs a flush command before relaunch).
4. Make `polar.json` read-only (or fill the disk) and change a setting: the app should
   say it could not save (the error comes with the next change after the failed write).
5. Edit `"version"` to 2 and start: a `polar.v2-<time>.json` copy appears next to it.
6. Linux/macOS: `ls -l polar.json` shows `-rw-------` after the first change.

## Downloads: pause, resume and stalls (R4, H9)

1. Start a download, pause and resume it several times quickly while it runs; when it
   finishes, play it through to the end, seeking around: no glitches or broken spots.
   While it runs the downloads folder holds `<name>.part`; when done, only `<name>`.
2. Pull the network cable mid-download: within about 30 s it shows "The source stopped
   sending." and can be resumed.
3. A download paused with an older build resumes from where it was.

## Player start-up steps (T-022)

The loading screen now lists each step under the logo while a video starts, says
where it failed, and has **Copy Details**.

How to check (needs mpv installed, then again without it for the built-in player):

1. Play anything that works. Under the logo you should see, in order and with times:
   `Player: mpv`, `Asking your add-ons for sources`, `Found N sources from M add-ons`,
   `Source 1 of 5: …`, `Link: direct file (.mkv) on <host>`, `Contacting <host>`,
   redirects if any, `206 Partial Content from <host> · video/… · <size> · <time>`,
   `Handed to mpv, opening the file`, `Container: …`, `Tracks: …`, `File opened · … long`,
   `Buffering N%`, `Playing`. Only the last five lines show while loading.
2. A link that fails: `scripts/open-films-addon.ts` serves on 127.0.0.1, which is
   not checked (it says `Not checked: a server on this computer`). To see a failure,
   install an add-on whose stream answers 404 (or edit the script's URL to a missing
   file on a public host): the screen should say the 404, `Failed at the source's
   server`, show the whole log scrolling, and **Copy Details** should copy it.
3. Paste the copied text somewhere: it must hold no full links (only hosts in
   `<…>`), no add-on config, no tokens, no home folder, no LAN address.
4. Without mpv: the same steps come from the built-in player (it now runs the same
   link check first, `stream_probe`); an MKV should end with `Built-in player:
   format not supported` and the "needs mpv" message.
5. Watch party: a source that doesn't start in 20 s logs `Not playing after 20 s`.

Not covered: HLS playlists are checked like files (the first 1 KB of the playlist).

## Anime links and episode context (T-005 step 3)

Opening an anime page (desktop or TV) now records which id the entry plays from
(`link_anime`); library items and progress kept under its Kitsu id move onto its
IMDb id. What the page lines up per episode (absolute number, MAL and Kitsu ids,
filler) is kept in localStorage (`polar.animePlayContext.v1`) instead of memory.

How to check:

1. Open an anime with an IMDb page and several seasons, play episode 2 a minute, quit
   Polarity. Start it again and play episode 2 from Continue Watching without opening
   the anime page: AniSkip's opening skip should appear, and the source list should
   include anime add-ons that only know Kitsu ids.
2. Turn on "skip filler" and, after a restart, let a show with filler episodes
   autoplay from Continue Watching up to a filler run: it should be skipped.
3. A show watched under `kitsu:N` before (an older Polarity build, a Kitsu-only show
   that later got an IMDb page): open its anime page; the library entry and the
   watched marks should now show under the IMDb title, once, in Library, History and
   Continue Watching.
4. Opening the same anime page twice must not change `updatedAt` of its link
   (`anime_links` in the devtools console: `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke("anime_links")`).

## Anime links through the account (T-005 step 5)

Signed-in profiles now sync their anime links through the new `anime_links` table
(`supabase/migrations/20261104000000_anime_links.sql`). The migration was run here
on PGlite (Postgres 17 in WebAssembly) after the first migration, with `auth.users`
and `auth.uid()` stubbed: older writes are ignored, newer ones win, alias ids and
AniList id 0 are refused, another user sees and writes nothing, deleting the
profile deletes its links. Not checked: a real Supabase project and two devices.

How to check:

1. Apply the migration to the project (`supabase db push`, or paste it into the SQL
   editor). In Table Editor, `anime_links` shows RLS enabled and one policy.
2. Device A, signed in: open an anime page. Within a few seconds a
   row for its AniList id appears in `anime_links`.
3. Device B, same profile, still holding that show's library entry or progress under
   `kitsu:N` (play it there once from an addon that lists it by Kitsu id before step
   2): after its next sync (focus the window), Library, History and Continue
   Watching show it once, under the IMDb title, without opening the anime page there.
4. A server without the migration: sync of library and progress must still work,
   with `sync failed` absent from the console. After applying the migration, the
   next sync sends every link the profile has (localStorage key
   `polar.animeLinksUnsent.v1` holds the profile id until then).

## Episode numbering with a TMDB key (T-005 step 6)

With a TMDB key, series episodes now carry IMDb's (Cinemeta's) season and episode
numbers: `crates/index/src/lib.rs` fetches Cinemeta's episode list next to TMDB's and
`polar_addon::numbering::renumber` matches them by air date (tested in
`crates/addon/src/numbering.rs`). `polar-index` does not compile on the dev machine
(T-012), so the wiring in `lib.rs` was checked by reading only.

How to check, with a TMDB key set in Settings:

1. Open a show TMDB splits into more seasons than IMDb (several long-running anime;
   check two). Seasons and episode numbers match the show's IMDb page; titles,
   stills and overviews are TMDB's.
2. Play an episode from season 2 or later: the addons find streams for that episode,
   not another one with the same TMDB numbers.
3. Progress saved before this change for such a show under TMDB's numbers stays under
   those ids: that episode shows as unwatched (not migrated; such progress could
   already point at the wrong episode for addons).
4. With Cinemeta unreachable the show still opens, with TMDB's numbers (log line
   `no IMDb numbering for tt…`).

## Compact account storage (T-010, T-027)

`supabase/migrations/20261105000000_compact_storage.sql` moves library and progress into
`library` and `progress` without any show information, keeps one progress entry per title, takes
keys and add-on links out of stored settings and drops the old tables (docs/supabase-storage.md).
Checked in PGlite (Postgres 17, `tests/sql/compactStorage.test.ts`, run by `bun run test` and on
every push in CI: every migration from empty, copy, codec in SQL and TypeScript alike, both
trigger modes, clamping, RLS between two users, anime links, playlist limit, the check script). Not checked: a real Supabase project, PostgREST's upsert through the trigger, and two
devices.

1. On a copy of the project run part 1 of `supabase/checks/compact_storage.sql`, apply the
   migration, run part 2: the counts must match, every other query returns 0 rows or 0.
2. Two devices signed in to one profile, both on this version: save a title and play an episode
   on one; after the other's next sync (focus its window) the title is in its Library and Continue
   Watching, with name and picture appearing once looked up. Library → Sort by Title works once
   names are in.
3. A device that had the titles before keeps its own names, pictures and every episode's position
   after pulling (only the newest episode per title is on the server).
4. Optional: run `supabase/optional/per_episode_progress.sql`, wait ten minutes (or restart both
   apps), play different episodes of one show on each: both keep both, with no setting on either.
   `per_episode_progress_off.sql` goes back the same way.
5. A version older than this one, signed in after the migration: library and progress no longer
   sync for it (expected, cut over at once); updating it pushes what it has.

## Settings sync without keys and add-on links (T-029, I-009)

Settings documents now carry only what a profile changed from the defaults (`settings_defaults`
command, not run here: src-tauri only type-checks), and keys and add-on links apart (#89). Tested here
as pure functions (`tests/settingsDoc.test.ts`, `tests/secrets.test.ts`); not run in the app.

1. Two devices, one profile: change Seek step on one; the other takes it after a sync. Set it back to
   the default on the first: the second goes back too.
2. #89: a TMDB key or an add-on added on one device appears on the other after a sync. Services and
   Add-ons pages and Settings → Account → API keys and addons say they're stored readable on the
   server; the Supabase table editor shows them in `profile_settings.data.secrets`.
3. #89: set a passphrase on the first device: `data` now has `sealed` and no `secrets`; the second
   device says "Locked" and asks for it, keeping its own keys meanwhile; a wrong one says it doesn't
   open them; the right one brings the keys. Change it on one device: the other asks again. Remove it
   (confirm): both show "Not encrypted" and `data.secrets` is back.
4. Sign out on a device that had its own keys and add-ons before signing in: they are back as they were.

## Sync leftovers: dirty set, per-key settings merge, playlists (T-053, R2)

Tested here: `crates/library` (`sync.rs` tests: pulled rows not sent back, an edit during a push, a
clock stepping back, a store from before the dirty set), `tests/spacePush.test.ts`,
`tests/settingsDoc.test.ts` (merge, first round, unknown keys, other passphrase),
`tests/playlistSpaces.test.ts` (newer-version playlists, the 100 limit), and in PGlite that a settings
write the server skips comes back with no row and a too-large one fails with 23514. Not run in the app or
against a real project.

1. Two devices, one profile, both offline: change Seek step on one and Subtitle size on the other, then
   go online. Both end with both changes (before, the later device's whole document won).
2. Add an add-on on a device signing in to an existing profile for the first time: it stays.
3. Update the app on a device that already had an account: the first round pushes only what changed since
   its last push before the update (no full re-upload); after that, a pull is not pushed back (Supabase
   logs: no library/progress upserts right after a pull with nothing changed here).
4. Watch something while offline with the clock set an hour back, then fix the clock and go online: the
   progress still goes up.
5. 100 playlists: New Playlist disappears from Library, the card menu, the title page and TV; delete one
   and it comes back.
6. Settings → Account says "too large to sync" only when add-on links push the document past the
   server's 16 KB; removing some makes it sync again without a restart.

## Platform layer (T-030, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

- Window, updates and native events now go through `src/lib/platform` (built and type-checked here, never run in
  the shell). To check on a desktop: the window buttons (Windows) minimise, maximise and close; F in the player and
  TV mode go fullscreen and back; Settings → Interface size still zooms; with a controller plugged in at launch the
  "connected" toast shows; the player's loading screen lists its steps and Copy details says the right system
  (Windows / macOS / Linux); Settings → About → Check for updates still answers.
- Linux: `mpv_available` is now false there (mpv can't draw into a GTK window), so the player always says
  "Player: built-in". Before, an mpv on PATH made it pick mpv and fail with "isn't supported on this system yet".
  To check: on Linux with mpv installed, play anything that `<video>` can play (MP4/H.264).
- Apple TV: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §3 says tvOS has no web view and Tauri 2 doesn't target it (from Tauri's list of
  supported platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS). Check before planning cycle 3.

- Narrower web view policy (R4 M2/M20): `connect-src` now names its hosts and `opener:default` is gone. Checked
  here only by `tests/webviewPolicy.test.ts`, which reads the code for the hosts it fetches. To check on a desktop:
  open the devtools console (right-click → Inspect in a debug build) and look for "Refused to connect" while you
  sign in, start a Watch Party (Supabase realtime over `wss://`), open Anime and an anime title (AniList, ani.zip),
  play an anime episode with skip times (AniSkip), open Discover's add-on list, and run Check for updates. Links
  (Trailer → YouTube, Credits) must still open in the browser and Downloads → Show in folder still reveal the file.
  A self-hosted Supabase (not `*.supabase.co`) is refused until its host is added to `connect-src`.

## Add-on request headers on playback (R4 M19)

- mpv now gets the stream's User-Agent/Referer/Origin from `behaviorHints.proxyHeaders.request` as
  `http-header-fields`, set by `set_property` with a JSON list before each `loadfile`. Tested here: which headers
  pass (`crates/player/src/headers.rs`) and that the link check sends them through a redirect (`probe.rs`
  `sends_the_addons_headers_on_every_hop`). Not run: mpv itself. To check on Windows or macOS: install an add-on
  whose streams carry `proxyHeaders` (or serve one from `scripts/open-films-addon.ts` with a Referer check on the
  file server); before this change it downloaded but failed with "The source answered 403", now it plays. Then play
  a normal source with an external subtitle to see no header is left over.
- A source that needs a Cookie or Authorization header still fails to play (only downloads send those); on Linux
  the built-in player can't send any header.

## Links served over HTTP or WebDAV (#139, docs/stream-links.md)

- Tested here: the link check against local servers (`crates/addon/src/probe.rs`): a login in
  the link or in the redirect's new link is sent as Basic auth, a file server without it is
  refused at once with 401, a first byte at 600 ms of a 2 s limit still plays (the defaults are
  20 s and 25 s), a link that doesn't answer within the source list's 3 s reads "Slow to
  answer"; `videoSize`/`filename` in the source list (`rank.rs`) and in the subtitles request
  (`crates/addon/tests/addon_server.rs`). Not run: mpv, the built-in player, the app.
- To check on Windows, macOS and Android with mpv: start `scripts/open-films-addon.ts` with
  `--file`, `--auth user:secret --slow 10 --host 0.0.0.0` (docs/stream-links.md) and add it by
  the computer's network address. Play Big Buck Bunny: the loading screen shows the 302 and a
  206 after about 10 s, without the login; the video plays, seeks without starting over (the
  script's server answers Range), and resumes from where it stopped after leaving the player.
  The source row shows the file's exact size. Then without `--auth`/`--slow`, to see nothing
  changed for a plain link.
- The built-in player with a login in the link: Chromium-based web views (WebView2 on Windows
  without mpv, Android System WebView in an APK without libmpv) are expected to refuse video
  links with a login in them; WebKitGTK (Linux) and WKWebView (iOS) not known. Same check as
  above in each; if it fails, the loading screen ends with the player's error.

## Log file (R4 M14)

- The rotation (`crates/library/src/logfile.rs`) is tested here; the app's wiring (`src-tauri/src/logging.rs`) is
  only type-checked. To check on a desktop: start Polarity, then open the log folder the README names; `polar.log`
  starts with "Polarity <version> starting". Remove the MDBList key's last letter and open a title: a "ratings
  from api.mdblist.com failed" line appears without the key in it. Search the file for your keys and add-on links:
  none should be there.
- The Linux path assumes Tauri's `app_log_dir` is `~/.local/share/<identifier>/logs`; check it once on Linux.

## Title logos measured through the app (#354)

A logo whose host sends no CORS headers is fetched by the app (`picture_bytes`, `crates/addon/src/pictures.rs`)
so its contrast is still checked. The fetch is tested here against a local server; the command and the web view
side (bytes to a blob picture) are only type-checked and tested with a stand-in. Which real image hosts refuse
CORS couldn't be checked from this machine. To check on a desktop:
1. Open the page of a show whose logo is dark ink on a dark backdrop: it shows as a white silhouette or with a
   halo, on the page and on the Home banner when it's featured there.
2. Open `polar.log`: no "logo: no picture from" lines for logos that showed. Turn off the network after the
   pages load and open a new title: a line naming only the image host (no link, no title) may appear, and the
   name or the logo as it is shows.

## Name and sign-in session in the keychain

- The name is Polarity in the installer (`productName`), README, the log's first line, the User-Agent
  (`polarity/<version>`) and the UI; the app id `app.getpolar.desktop` stays, so data, log and web view folders
  don't move. Not seen: whether the Windows installer of "Polarity" upgrades an installed "Polar" in place or
  installs beside it (NSIS keys its folder by product name), and the macOS bundle now being `Polarity.app`.
- The session's layout in the keychain (`crates/library/src/keychain.rs`, split into chunks under Windows'
  limit, a failed write keeps the old value) and the web view's side (`src/lib/platform/keychain.ts`: move on
  first start, fall back, read once per run) are tested here. `src-tauri/src/keychain.rs` over `keyring` 4 is
  only type-checked (Linux and Windows); no keychain was touched on this machine. To check on each system:
  sign in, quit, start again: still signed in, and an entry under `app.getpolar.desktop` is in Keychain Access
  (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows) or Seahorse/KWallet (Linux). Signed in with an older build, the first
  start of this one keeps you signed in and moves the session there. On Linux without a Secret Service, sign-in
  still works and is kept by the app itself. Sign out: the entries are gone.
- Phones: no keyring store is wired yet (`keyring` isn't built for Android/iOS); the session stays in the web
  view's storage there.

## API keys and add-on links in the keychain (#195)

- How they leave `polarity.json` and come back is tested here (`crates/library/src/vault.rs`: moved on the first
  save, filled back at start, a key in the file wins, no keychain = asked once and kept in the file, an unreadable
  keychain never written over, `tests/deviceStore.test.ts` for the Account text). The saver's use of it and
  `secrets_place` are only type-checked; no keychain was touched on this machine. To check on each desktop
  system: with a TMDB key and a keyed add-on installed, start this build once and change any setting. Then
  `polarity.json` has `"secretsInKeychain":true`, no key and empty `manifestUrl`s, and an entry `polar.vault` under
  `app.getpolar.desktop` is in Keychain Access (macOS), Credential Manager (Windows) or Seahorse/KWallet (Linux).
  Quit and start again: the key and add-ons work. Settings → Account → API keys and addons → On this device names
  the keychain. On Linux without a Secret Service: keys stay in the file and the text says so. With the keyring
  locked and the prompt dismissed at start: the text says the keychain couldn't be read, and a key typed then is in
  the file and still there after the next start with the keyring open.
- The web view's own copy (settings sync's last agreed keys and links, links not installed yet, the passphrase)
  moves from its storage into `polar.sync.<profile>` entries the first time a profile is used
  (`src/lib/account/localSecrets.ts`, tested in tests/settingsSync.test.ts with a keychain in memory). To check:
  signed in with a passphrase set by an older build, start this one: still "Encrypted" in Settings → Account, no
  passphrase prompt, and a `polar.sync.<id>` entry in the keychain.
- Going back to an older build after this one moved them: the older build sees no keys and add-ons without links;
  enter them again there.
- Phones: no keyring store is wired (`keyring` isn't built for Android/iOS); keys stay in the app's private data file.

## Phone and tablet layouts (T-033)

- The layouts were first checked by reading the CSS, and the form-factor rules by tests
  (tests/formFactor.test.ts); since T-051 they have been seen at 390×844 in a headless Chromium with an iPhone
  user agent (next section). Nothing here has been seen on a real phone or tablet: the mobile shells don't
  exist yet (cycle 3).
- To check on Windows now (the app only starts in its shell): `bun run app`, open DevTools in the window
  (right-click → Inspect), turn on device emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M) as a Pixel or iPhone and reload: the user
  agent makes it a phone. Look for: the tabs in a bar along the bottom,
  More taking what doesn't fit; Back, search and the profile at the top; the last row of each page clear of the
  tab bar; the home hero's text across the card with Next at its top right; a show's episode list with the
  number above the title; no window buttons. As an iPad: the desktop layout with 44 px bar icons.
- A desktop window narrower than 600 px now gets the hero and episode-list changes too (not the tab bar).
- Touch: a tap on the playing video shows or hides the controls whatever "Clicking the video" says.

## Screens, player and engine after R5 (T-008)

- Player: the clock, skip button, Up Next and the 75 % prefetch now follow the playhead through
  `useMediaTime` instead of re-rendering the whole player four times a second. Seen working here in headless
  Chromium with the built-in player (the fake shell's links answered by a test file): the clock ticks, ← / →
  seek, Space pauses and the clock stops, clicking the clock cycles remaining / elapsed / ends at, Sources opens,
  Esc leaves; on a series Up Next appears in the last 40 s and the next episode starts by itself after the
  countdown. Not seen: mpv (Windows, macOS), where time comes from mpv's reports. To check on a desktop: play an
  episode, watch the clock and scrubber for a minute (smooth, no jumps), let it reach the credits (Up Next), and
  open each panel while it plays.
- Screens load their own code the first time they open: the player (fetched once the app is idle), TV mode,
  Settings, sign-in and profiles, an anime's page, and the avatar art. All seen opening in Chromium except
  sign-in and profiles (no account there). To check in the app: sign out and in, switch to TV mode, open
  Settings, an anime and a profile menu; each should appear at once, without a blank frame.
- Library: Saved, Watched, Playlists and Downloads, and each playlist, are pages of their own: Esc and the
  mouse's back button step out one page (seen in Chromium). A new playlist still opens with its name selected.
- Accessibility: with "Show titles" off, cards keep their title as their name for screen readers; the season
  picker, episode ranges and anime schedule days are radio groups. Not checked with a screen reader: try
  Narrator or VoiceOver on a title page and the nav tabs (Enter and Space open a tab).
- mpv engine (only type-checked): closing the app while mpv is busy now kills mpv; if mpv exits, waiting calls
  fail at once instead of after 5 s; autocrop stops when mpv shuts down after being idle; frame snapshots for
  the blurred overlays use their own file each. To check on Windows: play something, quit the app from the tray
  or Alt+F4 mid-load, and see that no `mpv.exe` stays in Task Manager. If the app itself crashes, mpv can still
  be left running (no Windows Job Object yet, T-052).
- The link check gives up after 25 s in all and lets the player try the link (tested here against a slow
  local server). Subtitles in UTF-16 or Windows-1252 now show their accents and curly quotes (tested); an
  add-on subtitle without a language is listed as "Unknown language".
- Shortcuts synced between a Mac and a PC: Ctrl+K set on Windows arrives as ⌘K on the Mac. Tested as functions
  only; check by changing a ⌘ shortcut on one machine and looking at Settings → Controls on the other.

## Autocrop: every change a jump, the frame on screen's own crop (docs/autocrop.md §4, §6; #344)

- `crop::CropZoom`, `frames::Frames`, `lookahead::Timeline` and `lookahead::CutSearch` are tested in
  `crates/player` (stepping back and forth across a change, a change between keyframes, a seek, a late reading);
  their wiring in `src-tauri/src/player/autocrop.rs` and the exact probe in `preroll.rs` only type-check here
  (no mpv may run on this machine). To check on the Windows build, autocrop and "Look ahead for bar changes" on,
  on a file whose bars change between keyframes:
  - the log has no `eased` lines; changes say `jump`, and the one between keyframes says `found between
    keyframes` (logged a frame before it, as `from <pts>` of the frame it lands on);
  - stepping with `,` and `.` across the change: every frame with its own crop, both ways, no zoom animation;
  - playing across it: no frame with the wrong crop; whether a jump lands on its frame with
    `--video-sync=display-resample` and without;
  - a seek past what the lookahead read: playback pauses for a moment (at most 2 s) and starts with the right crop;
  - that `seek … absolute+exact` in the third mpv (`--hr-seek=yes`) lands on the frame asked for, and how long a
    search takes (each reading decodes from the keyframe before; log `autocrop lookahead: frames between
    keyframes can't be read exactly here` if that mpv couldn't open the source a third time).
- Paused right after a step, the zoom is sent once mpv reports the new `time-pos`, so mpv may draw the stepped
  frame once with the zoom before it: whether that can be seen is for the desktop build.
- Animated bars (a film that opens or closes its own bars within a shot), autocrop on: `Sampler::lead`,
  `Sampler::predict` and `CropTracker::lead` are tested in `crates/player` with screenshots arriving 2 frames
  late; the engine only type-checks here. To check:
  - Windows, "Check every frame for black bars" on: the crop follows the moving bars on every frame (no bar or
    picture edge lagging while they move), and the log says `following animated bars`; cropdetect still runs
    (hardware decoding copies back, `hwdec-current` ends in `-copy`); GPU and CPU in Task Manager against the
    setting off. The same with the setting off (cropdetect leads there too while screenshots are taken).
  - macOS: the crop can be a frame or two off while bars move: opening bars may show a few pixels of bar where
    they stop, closing bars a few pixels of bar while they move, and neither should cut into the picture.
    Whether that can be seen at normal speed, and how often a reading's pts is unsure (no prediction then).

## Autocrop pre-roll probe (docs/autocrop.md §3)

- `crop::opening_points`, `crop::opening_bars`, `CropTracker::open`, the PNG reader (`polar_player::png`) and
  the detector on RGB screenshots are tested in `crates/player`; the probe itself
  (`src-tauri/src/player/preroll.rs`) and its wiring in `mpv_load` and the autocrop loop only type-check here
  (no mpv binary may run on this machine). Unknown, to check on the Windows build with autocrop on:
  - that `screenshot-to-file … video` works with `--vo=null --screenshot-sw=yes` and writes a PNG with stored
    (uncompressed) data at `--screenshot-png-compression=0` (if not, the probe finds nothing and playback starts
    uncropped, as before: no harm, but no gain);
  - how many of the 8 keyframes arrive within the 1.5 s budget on a typical stream (log line
    `autocrop pre-roll: N readings` at debug level), and that a scope film's first frame is already cropped;
  - that the probe's mpv is gone after each load (Task Manager) and its `probe-N` folder removed;
  - HDR: whether software screenshots of PQ video are tone-mapped enough for the HDR levels to read the bars.
- macOS has no probe yet (libmpv in the app, no second instance): films start uncropped there, as before.

## Autocrop lookahead (docs/autocrop.md §4)

- `lookahead::Schedule` and its hand-over to `CropTracker::cut` are tested in `crates/player`; the engine side
  (`preroll::ahead`, a second probe that follows the playhead, and `take` per frame in the autocrop loop) only
  type-checks here. To check on the Windows build with autocrop and "Look ahead for bar changes" on:
  - that the probe's `seek 0.1 relative+keyframes` (doubled while it lands on the same keyframe) steps keyframe
    by keyframe, and stays about 60 s ahead of the playhead (a scope film with an IMAX sequence: the crop
    should jump on the cut frame into and out of it);
  - frame-exact landing, with `--video-sync=display-resample` and without (§4);
  - that it starts again after a seek back, a seek forward and a pause; that its mpv (`ahead-N`) is gone after
    the next load, after switching it off, and when the app closes;
  - cost, 10 minutes each on a 10 Mbit/s MKV and an HLS stream: extra bytes (the probe's `raw-input-rate`),
    the probe's CPU time against playback alone. Then the defaults per device (§7).
- Switching the lookahead on mid-file takes effect from the next file; macOS has no lookahead (no probe).

## Our autocrop detector on the desktop (docs/autocrop.md §2)

- `sampler::Sampler` (which reading feeds the tracker, when to take a screenshot) is tested in `crates/player`;
  the engine side (`take_shot` in `src-tauri/src/player/autocrop.rs`) type-checks for Linux and Windows here,
  and the macOS side (`polar_mpv_frame` in `src-tauri/src/macos/mpv_view.m`, `mac::Frames`) builds only on CI's
  macOS runner. To check with autocrop on, on a scope film with bars changing (an IMAX sequence) and a film
  that moves its own bars:
  - Windows, default: the log's `autocrop:` lines show screenshots only around changes (none on a still
    letterbox); a change of bars lands within a frame or two of its cut; moving bars are followed frame by
    frame. Check that `screenshot-to-file … video` is the frame unzoomed (with the crop applied, our readings
    still find the bars rather than full frame).
  - Windows, "Check every frame for black bars" on: the log's screenshots per second and MB/s written, and mpv's
    and Polarity's CPU in Task Manager against autocrop with the setting off, on a 1080p and a 4K file. Put
    the numbers in docs/autocrop.md §2 and the setting's caption.
  - macOS: every frame read in memory (`screenshot-raw video` through a weak client): the log's screenshots per
    second (no MB written), CPU against autocrop off; a change lands within a frame or two of its cut; nothing
    hangs when playback stops or the window hides mid-read; hardware decoding stays zero-copy.

## Windows mpv.exe built from pinned sources (`scripts/windows-mpv.sh`, CI job `windows-mpv`)

- Until this change the Windows app shipped shinchiro's prebuilt `mpv.exe`; now CI builds it with the same
  scripts at a fixed commit, every library at the commit `scripts/windows-mpv.lock` gives it, and the release
  attaches the exact sources. The build only runs in CI (in the Arch Linux image of `scripts/windows-mpv.Dockerfile`); nothing
  here has run it. The `mpv.exe` that ships is a different build, so it needs a check on a Windows PC. It is
  winbuild's clang build for plain x86-64 (no AVX2 needed), with libc++ linked in and the Universal CRT
  (part of Windows 10 and 11), so it should also start on an older x86-64 PC.
- Get it: once CI's `windows-mpv` job has passed on the commit, `bun scripts/fetch-mpv.ts` on the PC (GitHub CLI
  signed in) puts it into `src-tauri/vendor/mpv`; then `bun run tauri dev`, or a release build.
- Check: a film and an episode play with picture and sound, hardware decoding on (Settings → Playback), seeking,
  subtitles (an embedded track and an add-on one), audio track switching, HDR on an HDR screen, autocrop on a
  letterboxed film, and a stream over HTTPS. `licenses/mpv/BUNDLED.txt` in the installed app lists the libraries,
  and the release lists `Polarity_<version>_x64_mpv-sources.tar` among its files.

## Torrent sources (#47)

- Checked here: `crates/torrent`'s loopback test (a second session shares a made-up file; the engine fetches it
  with no DHT or trackers, serves it with ranges, seeks, closes, keeps it when sharing, refuses a file over the
  cache limit and a file index the torrent lacks); the step lines and limits in `tests/torrentSteps.test.ts`;
  the app side type-checks for Linux and Windows. Not run here: a real swarm, mpv or `<video>` playing the
  loopback link, the DHT from a home network.
- To check on Windows, macOS and Linux, with a stream add-on of your own that returns torrent streams of a file
  you're entitled to watch (an open film):
  - The loading screen shows "Looking for peers", "File list from peers … file N of M (.mkv, size)", then a
    peer line that updates in place, then mpv's buffering lines; it starts within a few seconds of the first
    peers. Seeking far ahead resumes after a short wait (those pieces are fetched first). Copy details shows no
    file name, hash or link beyond "this computer".
  - The first torrent source on the computer shows the "Torrent playback" notice before anything is opened
    (checked here in the browser with the fake backend: Cancel leaves the player and opens nothing, Play goes on,
    and the next torrent plays without it). On the app: Cancel starts no peer traffic; the notice's upload limit
    is the one in Settings; "Explain torrent playback first" in Settings brings it back.
  - Settings → Sources → Torrent Sources: a download limit of 5 Mbit/s holds the download near 600 KB/s (Task
    Manager / Activity Monitor); with default settings the upload stays near 500 KB/s (4 Mbit/s) and the
    download isn't held back; the upload limit also holds while "Keep sharing after playback" keeps a torrent.
    A cache limit smaller than the file refuses it with a message naming both sizes.
  - Close the player: `torrent-cache` in the app's cache folder (Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\app.getpolar.desktop`,
    macOS `~/Library/Caches/app.getpolar.desktop`, Linux `~/.cache/app.getpolar.desktop`) is empty again within
    a second or two, and upload stops. With "Keep sharing after playback" on, it stays and keeps uploading until
    Polarity quits; the next start finds the folder empty.
  - No firewall prompt appears (the engine doesn't listen; it connects out).
  - iPhone and iPad: a torrent source says it doesn't play there.

## Torrent sources on Android (#207)

- Checked here: the Android build type-checks with the engine (clippy for `aarch64-linux-android`), the
  `polar-torrent` test binaries build for `x86_64-linux-android`, and in the browser (fake backend) a torrent on mobile data is passed over for the next source, or with
  none left fails with the reason and Open Settings; the setting is on Settings → Sources (phone) and TV Settings
  → Sources. Not run here: an Android device or emulator playing a torrent, real networks, battery saver.
- To check on an Android phone and an Android TV, with your own add-on returning torrent streams of a file you're
  entitled to watch (an open film):
  - On Wi-Fi: the source plays as on desktop (notice the first time, peer lines, then the picture).
  - On mobile data (Wi-Fi off) with "Play torrent streams on mobile data" off: the torrent doesn't start; the
    loading screen says why and has Open Settings (phone); with other sources the next one plays instead. With the
    setting on, it plays.
  - Close the player: `adb shell run-as app.getpolar.desktop ls cache/torrent-cache` is empty within a second or
    two, and the app's network use (Settings → Network → Data usage) stops growing.
  - Play, press Home, wait more than 30 seconds, come back: the player says playback stopped while Polarity was
    in the background, the cache folder is empty, and no data is used meanwhile. Back within 30 seconds, it plays on.
  - Battery saver on with "Keep sharing after playback" on: closing the player still empties the cache.

## Seasons as separate shows (#22)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/animeEntries.test.ts`) and an end-to-end test of Continue Watching
on the fake backend. AniList can't be reached here, so with the setting on, check in the app:
- Anime page, search and Browse: a show with several seasons shows a card for each; off again, one.
- An entry's page: no season tabs, only its episodes; its prequel and sequel under Related.
- Watch an episode of a second season from its page, then Home: Continue Watching shows that
  season's name and poster and "Episode N"; it opens that season's page. Library and Watched too.
- TV mode: the same cards; a card opens the show's page with only that season's episodes.
- Switching the setting off and on loses no progress or library items.

## Anime no mapping knows yet (#189)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/animeTitleLink.test.ts`: an invented show only its synonym finds, one the
catalogs have no dated episodes for, the id lists, a stored pick, wrong years and names, failed searches) and
component tests (`tests/dom/animeSeriesPick.test.tsx`). Not run against AniList, ani.zip or a real catalog
(none reachable here). To check:
- Open a TV anime from the current season that ani.zip and the id lists don't map yet (its page used to say
  "Not linked to any sources yet" while Search found it under Series). It now plays from that series.
- Find one that still isn't linked (or open one and pick the wrong series): "Choose the series" opens a search
  with its name; pick the series; the page plays from it. Restart, and open it on a second signed-in device:
  the same series. "Wrong series?" changes it back.

## Watching a link together (#136)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/partyLinks.test.ts`: which links pass, their ids, the room's message
rules), component tests (`tests/dom/partyLink.test.tsx`: the confirmation, the form turning a page
down and starting a party on a file) and the readiness check's HLS/DASH answers (`crates/addon` probe
tests). The fake shell has no account, so no party runs end to end here. With two signed-in profiles
on two devices, check:
- Player → Watch Party → Watch a Link: paste a direct `.mp4` link. A party starts on it (or, in one,
  the room switches to it); your player opens it at once.
- The other device shows "<name> put on a link" with the full address, before anything loads. Play
  opens it in sync; Not Now leaves the player (out browsing, the room doesn't wait for you).
- Joining a party that's on a link: the same question first.
- Pause, seek and drift correction work as for a title. No Sources or Episodes button, no title
  page behind Back, nothing in Continue Watching, no Discord status.
- An HLS (`.m3u8`) and a DASH (`.mpd`) link both play; a link to a web page says it's a page, not a
  video; a link that answers 403 or 404 says so.
- The profile menu's Join Watch Party dialog: "or watch a link together" starts a party on a link.
- A YouTube link (#201): paste a `youtube.com/watch?v=`, a `youtu.be/`, a Shorts and an embed link of the same
  video on one device each time. YouTube's own player opens in the player with its own controls (#384), and
  nothing of Polarity's covers any part of it: a slim bar above it (Back; in a party, the faces that open the
  Watch Party panel) collapses to a strip once it plays and comes back with the pointer on the top edge or a key;
  the party panel opens beside the video (below it in a window standing upright), which shrinks to make room;
  C and R say captions and speed are in YouTube's player; Space and the arrow keys still drive it while the
  frame doesn't have the focus; the other device follows pause and seeks. A video whose owner doesn't allow
  embedding says so. Checked here only against a stand-in for YouTube's embed (e2e), not YouTube itself, and not
  on macOS (`tauri://` origin), Windows, Linux, Android or iOS web views: there, check that YouTube's CC,
  settings and fullscreen buttons work, and what its title and logo links do (the frame allows no popups).
- TV mode: the question shows and works with a remote (Play focused, Back is Not Now). There's no
  link field in TV mode.

## Discord buttons and joining from Discord (#153, #154, #357, #376)

Checked here: the activity's button and its limits, the join secret and party that replace it in a
joinable party, the join events over a stand-in for Discord's socket (a join passed on, a request to
join accepted only while the activity offers one, PING answered) and the launch registration's desktop
entry and macOS command file (`src-tauri/src/discord.rs` tests: type-checked in src-tauri, which
doesn't link here, and run in a copy of the module without Tauri), polarity:// link parsing (`tests/deepLink.test.ts`), the join desk
and the sealed code on a simulated channel (`tests/discordJoin.test.ts`: Anyone, Ask me, decline,
timeout, lock, busy, token rotation, a forged answer, refusal or "seen"), the website's /watch and /party pages at a
desktop and a phone width, and end to end in the browser shell with two pages as two members (e2e:
the host allows a request from a party link and the joiner lands in the party; a polarity://title
link opens the title). Not run: a real Discord client, a real Realtime project, an installed build's
link registration, Discord starting Polarity for a join. Discord shows buttons only to others, never on your own profile, so this needs two
Discord accounts (A with Polarity, B to look at A's profile), and for joining a second computer with
Polarity signed in. Check:
1. A: Settings → Playback → Show on Discord → That you're watching. Play something: B sees "Watching
   Polarity", first line "Watching on Polarity", no buttons.
2. A: What you're watching: B sees "Watch in Polarity". B clicks it: the browser opens
   getpolar.app/watch/…; with Polarity installed it opens on that title's page (a running Polarity comes
   to the front instead of starting again); without it, after a moment the page offers the download.
3. A starts a watch party: B sees Discord's own Ask to Join on A's activity (also in "That you're
   watching"), and no Watch in Polarity. A locks the party: Ask to Join goes within a few seconds;
   unlocking brings it back.
4. "Who can join from Discord" = Ask me, Polarity running on B's computer: B presses Ask to Join. No
   browser opens: B's Polarity comes to the front and asks "Join a watch party?" with B's profile
   name (A's Discord may show Discord's own request briefly; A's Polarity accepts it there by itself).
   Ask to Join: "Waiting for the host to let you in…", A sees "<B's profile name> wants to join".
   Allow: B's Polarity joins and plays in step. Again with Decline: B is told the host declined. No
   answer for two minutes: declined by itself.
5. Again with Polarity closed on B's computer (run once before, so it registered itself with
   Discord): pressing Ask to Join starts Polarity, and the question still comes (Discord holds the join
   for three minutes). Where to look if not: Windows `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\discord-<id>`,
   Linux `~/.local/share/applications/discord-<id>.desktop` (`xdg-mime query default
   x-scheme-handler/discord-<id>`), macOS `~/Library/Application Support/discord/games/<id>.json`; the
   log says "discord: join arrived".
6. Anyone who sees it: B sees Join instead of Ask to Join, and is let in without A being asked.
   Nobody: neither, and Watch in Polarity is back with "What you're watching".
7. Linux: the .deb/.rpm register polarity:// on install; an AppImage registers it when it first runs.
   Windows: the installer registers it. macOS: the app bundle does.
8. Dev builds (#376), with `DEV_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` set and the released app installed on both
   computers: A plays in a dev build, B sees "Watching Polarity Dev". A starts a party in the dev
   build: B's Join opens B's dev build (`discord-<dev id>`, `polarity-dev://discord-join`), never
   the released app, also with B's dev build closed. Both apps running on A: B sees two separate
   activities. A dev build made without the variable: no activity on Discord, and Settings →
   Playback reads "Not set up for dev builds" under Show on Discord.

## Browser extension: Open in Polarity, Watch together (#208)

Checked here: the id parsing for every site (`extension/tests/ids.test.ts`), the button in stand-in
pages run with happy-dom (`extension/tests/content.test.ts`: title pages, an episode and list pages
showing nothing, Letterboxd's links arriving late, YouTube's start time and page changes without a
reload, Hide), the context menu with a stand-in browser API (`extension/tests/background.test.ts`),
the chain extension → website page → app link (`tests/extensionLinks.test.ts`), TMDB → IMDb on a
stand-in TMDB (`cargo test -p polar-index`), and end to end in the browser shell (a TMDB link opens the
title, one without an IMDb id says so, a video link asks and then starts the party). Not run: the
extension in a real browser (this machine's Chromium is a headless shell that can't load extensions,
and downloading another browser isn't allowed), the real sites, and the website pages deployed. Check,
with `cd extension && bun run build`, Polarity installed and signed in, and the website's /watch and
/party pages from this branch deployed (until then the buttons land on the old pages):
1. Chrome: Load unpacked `extension/dist/chrome`; Firefox: Load Temporary Add-on
   `extension/dist/firefox/manifest.json`. The permissions asked are the listed sites only, and the
   context menu.
2. Open in Polarity: a film and a show on IMDb (also IMDb in another language, `/fr/title/…`), on TMDB
   (needs a TMDB key in Polarity), on Trakt and on Letterboxd; an anime on AniList and on MyAnimeList,
   one with no IMDb id. Each opens the right title in Polarity. An IMDb episode, a list, a search, a
   person page and a title's cast page show no button.
3. If a site has changed how its title pages look (IMDb's `og:type`, Trakt's or Letterboxd's links to
   IMDb/TMDB), the button won't show there: that's what to report.
4. YouTube: play a video to a minute in, press Watch together in Polarity: Polarity shows "Watch
   together?", the video's title and link, "It starts at 1:00…"; Watch Together starts the party there.
   Move to another video without a reload: the button follows. A channel or the home page: no button.
5. Right-click a link to an `.mp4` (and open an `.mp4` in a tab and right-click the page): "Watch
   together in Polarity" is offered and starts a party after Polarity asks. On an ordinary link or page
   the item isn't there.
6. Polarity not installed: the page offers the download after a moment.

## Opening Stremio links in Polarity (#163)

Checked here: link parsing and where each kind goes, the setting's default and off state, and that an install link
never installs without Install (`tests/stremioLinks.test.ts`); the shell keeping stremio:// links
(`deep_link.rs` test); end to end in the browser shell (e2e: on by default, a stored off kept, turning it off and on, Cancel and
Install, an add-on that can't be read, an episode link, an unknown link). src-tauri is type-checked for
Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS but doesn't link here; the Android Kotlin compiles in CI only.
Not run: a real handler registration on any system. With an add-on configuration page that has an
"Install" button for Stremio (or a test page with a `stremio://addon.example.com/manifest.json` link
pointing at a real add-on you trust), check on each system, with and without Stremio installed:
1. Settings → Add-ons → Open Stremio links in Polarity is on on a fresh install (#428), and links open
   Polarity from the first start. An install that had it off keeps it off: with Stremio installed, its
   links still open Stremio; without it, Windows and Linux say no app opens them; macOS may open
   Polarity, which only says the setting is off.
2. With it off, turn it on. Windows: the link opens Polarity (a running Polarity comes to the front). Turn it off:
   with a per-user Stremio, its links open Stremio again; with no Stremio, nothing opens them.
   Linux: `xdg-mime query default x-scheme-handler/stremio` names Polarity's handler while on, and no
   longer once off. macOS: on, links open Polarity; off, they go back to Stremio when it's installed.
   Android: on, a link offers Polarity (with Stremio installed too, Android asks which app); off, it
   doesn't.
3. An install link shows the add-on's name, description and address with Install and Cancel. Cancel:
   not in Settings → Add-ons. Install: listed there.
4. A title link (`stremio:///detail/movie/tt…`) opens its page; an episode link
   (`stremio:///detail/series/tt…/tt…:1:2`) opens the show on that season with that episode's sources
   listed, nothing playing. A show Polarity opens on its anime page opens there, without picking the episode.
5. Any other stremio:// link opens Home with a note that Polarity can't open it.

## Watch party reliability (#203)

The party log, the heals and their harness: `lib/party/log.ts`, `lib/party/room.ts`, the reconnect in
`lib/account/supabase.ts`. Tested on a fake Realtime server that drops, delays and reorders messages, drops
connections loudly and silently, splits and loses presence updates, and forgets entries
(`tests/partyChaos.ts`): 60 random runs per test run (`PARTY_SEEDS=n` for more; 3,000 run here, one went to
8.5 s against the 8 s bound under heavy loss), and each problem it found as a named case
(`tests/partyChaosCases.test.ts`). Not run against Supabase Realtime. To check, with two signed-in devices
(A starts, B joins), on the same build:
1. B joins: within a few seconds both show both as Watching (never Disconnected while both are online).
2. Pull B's network for 30 s and plug it back: B's party shows "Reconnecting…", then both show both as
   connected again within about 10 s, on the same position and play state.
3. Put B to sleep (laptop lid, phone locked) for a minute and wake it: same as 2, and no "left"/"joined" notes
   on A if B came back within a few seconds.
4. Party menu → Copy Party Log on both: the logs line up (same member tags, same timeline versions), and
   carry no names, party code, titles or links.
5. If something goes wrong anyway, keep both logs: they show which messages and presence lists each side got.

## Presence limit and refused changes (#227)

Supabase Realtime closes a client's channel after 5 presence updates in 30 s (per connection), and a closed
channel still sends but hears nothing. `lib/party/room.ts` now sends each settled status once (a 1 s wait,
at most 5 per 32 s, the entry after each join included), reopens a channel the server closes, reconnects when its entry is still
out of date after a second try, drops a change the host refused, and shows a member that talks but is missing
from presence as Reconnecting. The fake server models the limit, the CLOSED status and the REST fallback
(`tests/partyChaos.ts`), with the cases in `tests/partyChaosCases.test.ts`. Not checked against Supabase:
whether the window resets on a channel rejoin over the same socket (assumed not), and the shape of the
"system" message that comes before CLOSED. To check, two signed-in devices (A starts, B joins):
1. B leaves the player and comes back five times in 20 s: Supabase's Realtime logs (Dashboard → Logs →
   Realtime) show no ClientPresenceRateLimitReached, and both show both as connected throughout.
2. B's party log has no "closed by the server" line; A's has no "talking, but missing from my presence list"
   lasting more than a few seconds.
3. With A paused, B presses play while A can't see B's entry (hard to force by hand: the logs show it as
   "refused vN by …"): B goes back to paused within a second or two.

## Letterboxd export import (#87)

Letterboxd doesn't publish its export's columns. The parser reads `Name`, `Year`, `Date`, `Watched Date` and
`Rating` by header name (any order, any case) from `watched.csv`, `diary.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `watchlist.csv`.
It was written from exports users have described, not from a real one. The tests use invented files of that shape.
To check, with a Letterboxd account that has a few watched, logged, rated and watchlisted films:
1. Letterboxd → Settings → Data → Export your data. In Polarity: Settings → Account (or Advanced when signed out) →
   Import from Letterboxd → Choose File… → the ZIP. The counts match the account: Watchlist, Watched, and Ratings
   with "Ratings aren't imported".
2. Import, with and without a TMDB key. The films land in the library (watchlist) and in History (watched) on the
   right days. A film logged twice in the diary shows its latest day.
3. Films with a common title (remakes) or with a different year on Letterboxd and the catalog are listed under
   "Films to pick". Picking one imports it, Search finds others, and Skip drops it.
4. Import the same ZIP again: nothing new is added.
5. Unzip the export and pick `watched.csv` and `watchlist.csv` together. The same counts show.

## AniList account link (#83)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/listSync.test.ts`: the sign-in code, the queue, the watched rule, sending and
reading back; `tests/listLinking.test.ts`; `tests/listImport.test.ts`), component tests
(`tests/dom/anilistLink.test.tsx`) and a desktop e2e test on the fake shell with a made-up AniList answer (a linked
profile reads its list for the import, then unlinks). Not run against AniList (not reachable here), and this build
has no AniList API client yet (`ANILIST_CLIENT_ID` in `src/lib/lists/signIn.ts` is empty, so Settings → Services →
AniList says it isn't set up). To check, after registering a client in AniList's developer settings with
`https://anilist.co/api/v2/oauth/pin` as its redirect and putting its id there:
1. Settings → Services → AniList → Open AniList: AniList's page asks to allow the client; copy the code it shows,
   paste it, Link. The row shows "Linked as <your AniList name>".
2. Play an episode of an anime on your list past the watched point (or mark it watched): within a few seconds
   AniList shows that episode count; the last episode of a show sets it to Completed.
3. An anime's page shows its AniList entry above the cast: change the status, the episode count and the score
   (in the account's score format); AniList shows each change. Several quick changes arrive as one.
4. Offline: mark an episode watched, then reconnect: the change reaches AniList after reconnecting or the next start.
5. Change an entry on AniList's site, restart Polarity: the anime page shows the new entry.
6. Import List…: the counts match the list (adult entries left out unless the account shows them); Import adds the
   shows and films to the library with their watched episodes; running it again adds nothing new.
7. Revoke Polarity in AniList's settings (Apps): the next change makes the row say "Sign in again".
8. A second profile, and a second device: each shows Off until it signs in itself; nothing about the AniList
   account appears in the Supabase tables.
9. On each desktop system, the sign-in is in the system's keychain (`polar.link.anilist.…`), not the web view's
   storage; on phones (no keychain yet) it is in the web view's storage.

## MyAnimeList account link (#84)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/malList.test.ts`: reading and writing MAL's list format, the sign-in with PKCE,
refreshing the tokens, the queue renewing a refused token, episodes going to each linked service), the relay's path
checks (`src-tauri/src/mal.rs` tests, type-checked here, run in CI), component tests (`tests/dom/malLink.test.tsx`)
and a desktop e2e test on the fake shell with a made-up list (a linked profile reads its list for the import, then
unlinks). Not run against MyAnimeList (no client id, and the relay only runs in the app). To check, after registering
a client at https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig (App Type "other", redirect `http://localhost/polarity-mal-sign-in`)
and building with its id in `VITE_MAL_CLIENT_ID`:
1. Settings → Services → MyAnimeList → Open MyAnimeList: allow Polarity; the browser goes to a page that doesn't load.
   Copy its address, paste it, Link. The row shows "Linked as <your MAL name>".
2. Play an episode of an anime on your list past the watched point (or mark it watched): MAL shows that episode count;
   the last episode sets it to Completed.
3. An anime's page shows "Your MyAnimeList" above the cast: change the status, episodes and score (0–10); MAL shows
   each change. Watching a completed show again: MAL shows it as re-watching (check that MAL's site shows
   `is_rewatching` the way Polarity sends it: status Completed with Re-watching ticked).
4. Offline: mark an episode watched, reconnect: the change arrives.
5. Change an entry on MAL's site, restart Polarity: the anime page shows the new entry.
6. Import List…: the counts match the list (adult entries are always left out: MAL's API doesn't say whether the
   account shows them); Import adds the titles with their watched episodes.
7. Tokens: the access token's real lifetime (MAL's page says both an hour and about a month). After it, a change still
   goes out (the link renews itself) and the row stays "Linked".
8. Revoke Polarity in MAL's settings: the next change makes the row say "Sign in again".
9. A second profile and a second device each show Off until they sign in; nothing about the MAL account appears in the
   Supabase tables.

## Trakt account link (#85)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/traktLink.test.ts`: the device code sign-in, refreshing and revoking the tokens, the
limits; `tests/traktSync.test.ts`: scrobbling, the history queue both ways, the pull after `last_activities`, the
watchlist switch, ratings; `tests/traktImport.test.ts`), component tests (`tests/dom/traktLink.test.tsx`,
`traktScrobble`, `traktRating`) and a desktop e2e test on the fake shell with a made-up account (a linked profile
imports its watchlist and what it watched, then unlinks). Not run against Trakt (no client id). To check, after
creating an API app at https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications (redirect `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`) and building with
its client id in `VITE_TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`:
1. Settings → Services → Trakt → Get a code: enter the code at trakt.tv/activate and allow Polarity. The row shows
   "Linked as <your Trakt name>". Check whether Trakt's device token answer works without a client secret; if Trakt
   refuses it, the sign-in says "Trakt didn't accept the sign-in" and the PR stays held.
2. Play a film or episode that has an IMDb id: your Trakt profile shows it as watching now; pause, then stop past
   80%: it is in the history once. Stop at 50%: no history entry, and the next play resumes there in Polarity.
3. Mark an episode watched by hand, then unwatched: Trakt's history follows both. Offline, mark one, reconnect: it
   arrives.
4. Watch something with another Trakt app (or check it in on trakt.tv), bring Polarity's window back after a few
   minutes: it shows as watched.
5. Turn on "Keep the library and the Trakt watchlist in step": add and remove a title in the library, then on
   trakt.tv: both sides follow. On a free account with a full watchlist, the row says it is full.
6. Rate a film and a show 1 to 10 on its title page: trakt.tv shows the ratings; a rating changed on trakt.tv shows
   on the title page after the next look.
7. Import from Trakt…: the counts match the account; Import adds the watchlist and the watched marks, and running it
   again adds nothing new.
8. An anime played from a Kitsu id says on its page that it isn't sent to Trakt, and nothing reaches Trakt.
9. Tokens: the access token's real lifetime; after it, a change still goes out and the row stays "Linked". Revoke
   Polarity in Trakt's settings: the next change makes the row say Trakt no longer accepts the sign-in.
10. Unlink: Polarity disappears from Trakt's connected apps. A second profile and device each show Off until they
    sign in; nothing about the Trakt account appears in the Supabase tables. On each desktop system the sign-in is in
    the system's keychain (`polar.link.trakt.…`).

## Simkl account link (#86)

Checked here: unit tests (`tests/simklLink.test.ts`: the PIN sign-in, refreshing and revoking the tokens, the daily
allowance; `tests/simklSync.test.ts`: scrobbling, the history queue both ways, the Plan to Watch switch;
`tests/simklPull.test.ts`; `tests/simklRatings.test.ts`; `tests/simklImport.test.ts`), component tests
(`tests/dom/simklLink.test.tsx`, `simklScrobble`, `simklPanel`) and a desktop e2e test on the fake shell with a
made-up account (a linked profile imports its Plan to Watch and what it watched, then unlinks). Not run against Simkl
(no client id). To check, after creating an app at https://simkl.com/settings/developer/ and building with its client
id in `VITE_SIMKL_CLIENT_ID`:
1. Settings → Services → Simkl → Get a code: enter it at simkl.com/pin and allow Polarity. The row shows "Linked as
   <your Simkl name>". Check that the token answer works without a client secret, and that a sign-in which doesn't
   grant write access is refused and said.
2. Play a film or episode that has an IMDb id, and an anime played from a Kitsu id: Simkl shows each as watching;
   stop past 80%: it is in the history once (for the anime, the right episode under the anime). Stop at 50%: no
   history entry.
3. Mark an episode watched by hand, then unwatched: Simkl's history follows both. Offline, mark one, reconnect: it
   arrives.
4. Watch something in another Simkl app (or mark it on simkl.com), bring Polarity's window back after 15 minutes: it
   shows as watched. Check the answer of the `simkl_ids_only` read (status and IMDb/Kitsu ids in it), and that a
   title removed on Simkl stays in Polarity.
5. Turn on "Keep the library and Simkl's Plan to Watch in step": add a film, a show and a Kitsu anime to the library:
   each lands on Plan to Watch (the anime under anime). Remove one still on Plan to Watch: it leaves Simkl. A title
   already Watching on Simkl doesn't move back to Plan to Watch.
6. On a title page, pick a list and a rating 1 to 10: simkl.com shows both; change them on simkl.com: the page shows
   them after the next look. Check the ratings answer's shape (`user_rating`, anime under `anime`, a removed rating as
   null). "View on Simkl" opens the title's page, also for a title reached through `/redirect` with a Kitsu id.
   "Remove from Simkl" takes it off every list, its history and its rating.
7. Import from Simkl…: the counts match the account; Import adds Plan to Watch and the watched marks, and running it
   again adds nothing new.
8. Unwatching a film removes it from Simkl's lists too (Simkl's own behaviour): check that this is still so.
9. Tokens: after a week the access token renews and changes still go out. Revoke Polarity in Simkl's settings: the
   next change makes the row say Simkl no longer accepts the sign-in.
10. The account's daily allowance: `X-RateLimit-Remaining` comes back on each answer; a day of normal use stays far
    below it.
11. Unlink: Polarity disappears from Simkl's connected apps. A second profile and device each show Off until they
    sign in; nothing about the Simkl account appears in the Supabase tables. On each desktop system the sign-in is in
    the system's keychain (`polar.link.simkl.…`).

## Friends (#135)

Checked here: the migration in PGlite (`tests/sql/friends.test.ts`: codes, requests, accepting, blocking,
the caps, invites, and who may listen to or show presence on `friends:<profile>` and `invites:<profile>`
as `friend_topic_allowed` decides), the store against a fake server (`tests/friendsStore.test.ts`), the
parsing (`tests/friends.test.ts`), and the panel, invite toast, settings and TV row in the browser with the
fake account (`fake.html?account=1`, e2e). Not checked against Supabase: Realtime itself. To check, apply
`supabase/migrations/20261108000000_friends.sql`, then with two accounts A and B on two devices:
1. A: profile menu → Friends → Turn On Friends; a code shows. B does the same, types A's code, Add: A's
   list shows B under Requests within a second or two (the server's "changed" broadcast), without reopening.
2. A accepts: B's list shows A as a friend, Online, with a green dot.
3. A starts a watch party on a title: within 15 s B sees "In a watch party · <title>"; B presses Join and
   ends up in A's party (or waits for A to let them in, if A asks first).
4. A, in the party, presses Invite on another online friend C: C gets the toast and joins from it.
5. A sets "Who sees what you watch" to Nobody: B sees "In a watch party" without the title. A sets "Who sees
   you're online" to Nobody: A shows Offline on B within 15 s; after B restarts, Realtime refuses B's join
   of `friends:<A>` (Dashboard → Logs → Realtime).
6. Throughout a party with Friends on, Realtime's logs show no ClientPresenceRateLimitReached (friends'
   presence shares the connection with the party's; it updates at most once per 15 s).

## AirPlay on macOS (#19)

Checked here: the link check and the hand-over between mpv and the receiver (`tests/airplayLinks.test.ts`,
`tests/dom/airplay.test.ts`), and the button, the "Playing on AirPlay" screen and coming back in an
end-to-end test with WebKit's AirPlay calls stood in for. Needs a Mac and an AirPlay receiver on the
same network:
- Play an MP4 or HLS source with mpv: an AirPlay button appears at the top right once the file has
  started. Pick the receiver: it plays from the same moment; the app shows "Playing on AirPlay".
- Play/pause, seeking, the 10-second skips and volume act on the receiver; the time and seek bar follow it.
- Open the AirPlay list again and pick this Mac: mpv carries on from the receiver's position.
- Continue Watching shows the receiver's position after leaving the player while casting.
- An MKV source, a source that needs add-on request headers, or a download: no AirPlay button.
- In a watch party there's no AirPlay button; while casting there's no Watch Party button.
- Without mpv (built-in player) the same, with the element on screen sent as it is.
- Subtitles: add-on subtitles go to the element as WebVTT tracks; whether the receiver shows them is
  untested. Subtitles inside the file aren't sent.

## Downloads page (#15)

Checked here: grouping, seasons, sorting, filters, search, totals and the saved view (`tests/downloadsView.test.ts`);
the page with 75 made-up downloads in the browser shell (`fake.html?downloads=many`) on desktop, phone and TV
(e2e: collapsed titles, a title kept open after a reload, search, In Progress, Delete All Watched, Delete Selected,
D-pad through titles and seasons); `disk.rs` type-checked for Linux, Windows, Android, macOS and iOS. Needs the app:
- The summary's "N GB free" matches the free space of the disk holding the downloads folder (Windows: the drive's
  free space in Explorer; macOS/Linux: `df -h` on the folder). It's left out, not wrong, when the system won't say.
- "Saved in" names the real folder (Videos/Polarity, or the app's folder on iOS and Android).
- Deleting many at once (Delete All Watched with a few dozen episodes) removes the files from that folder, and the
  rows fold away together without a jump.
- TV with a remote or controller: up and down pass over the downloads still coming down without opening their menu;
  A opens it.

## Scrolling long pages (#134)

Measured here in headless Chromium without a GPU (the fake backend, a production build and the dev server):
on Home, sitting still used the main thread about two thirds of the time (loading shelves' shimmer out of
view and the carousel dot's clip-path redrawn every frame) and now about none; scrolling the loaded page
took a median 25-30 ms of main-thread work per frame and now about 10 ms; Home had 250-400 compositor
layers (every shelf's edge blurs, shown or not) and now a few dozen. `e2e/performance.spec.ts` keeps those
three in check. Not measurable here: the GPU side (the compositor runs in software headless) and WebKitGTK.
To check on Windows (WebView2), and on Linux and macOS:
- Home, Series, Movies, Anime and the Settings window scroll smoothly with a mouse wheel and a trackpad,
  quickly and slowly, with the pointer over the cards; Task Manager shows Polarity's CPU near idle while
  Home sits still.
- A shelf's edges still blur and show the chevron while the pointer is over the shelf; the carousel's dot
  still fills with a round end; the colours behind the carousel still cross-fade.
- Windows: shelves far down Home appear without a blank flash when scrolled to quickly, and Back from a
  shelf's browse page lands where it was.
- If it still stutters on Windows: start Polarity with the environment variable
  `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9222`, open `edge://inspect` in Edge,
  inspect the app and record a Performance trace while scrolling; it names what's left. Still known: a shelf's first appearance costs a
  long frame (its cards styled and drawn for the first time).

## Signing in on a TV with a code (#133)

Checked here: the migration in PGlite, the Edge Function's steps against an in-memory database, the app's
waiting loop, and the screens in the browser shell with its stand-in account (e2e: desktop, TV, Settings →
Account → Sign in a TV). Not checked: a real Supabase project, Deno, or a real TV.

1. Apply `supabase/migrations/20261109000000_tv_sign_in.sql` and `20261110000000_tv_sign_in_limits.sql`; deploy with
   `supabase functions deploy tv-sign-in --no-verify-jwt`.
2. On a signed-out device (TV mode, or a second computer): Sign in with your phone / another device. A code shows.
3. On a signed-in device: Settings → Account → Sign in a TV, enter the code. "Sign in on <device>?" names the
   kind of device. Approve: within a few seconds the first device opens on "Who's watching?" (or the only profile).
4. Sign out on one device: the other stays signed in. Supabase → Authentication → Users shows two sessions.
5. Deny, and wait out a code (5 minutes): the first device says so and offers a new code. The same code twice is refused.
6. Table editor: `tv_sign_in` is empty after each sign-in; no plain codes or addresses in it.
7. Six codes from one network within five minutes: the sixth is refused ("Too many attempts").
8. The address the function counts is the caller's own, not one the caller made up: from one computer, send six
   `start` requests (`curl -X POST <project>/functions/v1/tv-sign-in -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d
   '{"action":"start","device":"Test"}'`), each with its own made-up `-H 'X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.N'` (N = 1…6).
   The sixth must be refused (429). If all six get a code, the platform keeps the caller's header first:
   `callerAddress` in `supabase/functions/tv-sign-in/handler.ts` has to read the entry the platform adds instead.
9. Supabase's own projects with the new publishable keys: check `generateLink` + `verifyOtp({ token_hash, type:
   "magiclink" })` still signs in (the function and the app use supabase-js 2).

## Notifications (#209)

Checked here: what's new (time zones, undated episodes, a whole season at once, the one-a-day rule,
nothing repeated after a restart, plans on phones) in `tests/notifications.test.ts`; Settings →
Notifications, a new episode's note and its click opening the show in the fake shell
(`e2e/desktop.spec.ts`); the native code type-checks for all five systems, Android's Kotlin compiles. None of
it was shown by a real system. To check, with New episodes, New seasons and Downloads switched on:
- **Each system**: a show in the library whose next episode comes out within the next hours shows one
  note when it does (or within three hours after); clicking it opens that show. A download finishing shows
  "Download finished"; clicking it opens the title. Turning a switch off stops that kind.
- **Windows**: only the installed app (its Start menu shortcut carries the app id `app.getpolar.desktop`);
  Settings → System → Notifications lists Polarity, and turning it off there makes Settings → Notifications
  say so.
- **macOS**: only the bundled `.app`; the first switch turned on asks for permission once; a note shows as a
  banner with Polarity in front too.
- **Linux**: GNOME and KDE show the note; a click on it (not just on Open) opens the show.
- **Android 13 and later**: the first switch asks for permission; with Polarity closed (swiped away), an
  episode with a listed air date still arrives at that time; a click with the app closed opens the show.
- **iOS**: as Android; background refresh isn't used, so only listed air dates arrive with the app closed.

## Dev channel (#355)

Checked here: the version rule, file names, which builds are kept and which files go, the feed's
updater entries and the kept list (`tests/devChannel.test.ts`); connection codes, refused keys and
that only dev builds read a stored connection (`tests/devDatabase.test.ts`); the workflow files parse,
the dev build's own name, identifier and link scheme agree between the overlay, the shell and the
web view (`tests/devChannel.test.ts`, `tests/deepLink.test.ts`), and `src-tauri` type-checks with
the new command. Nothing here ran on GitHub or in a built app. Once
the owner has added the dev key (docs/dev-channel.md, "What the owner sets up"):
1. Merge a pull request into `dev`: the "Dev build" workflow ends green and Releases has one "Dev
   build" pre-release (not "Latest") named by the merge's hash, with the installers, the mpv
   sources, the build's feed and `latest.json` (names in docs/dev-channel.md, "File names"; build 5,
   made before them, was checked on GitHub this way under its old names).
2. Install that build on Windows, macOS and Linux (AppImage): Settings → About says "Dev build <hash>
   (<version>)". Merge another pull request: the build offers the new one and updates to it.
3. About → Earlier builds lists both; Install this build on the older one downloads it; Restart to
   Update puts it in place. The next check offers the newest again; with Pause updates on, it doesn't
   until Check for Updates.
4. A fresh dev build: the profile menu says no database is connected; Settings → Advanced → Database
   takes a code from `scripts/devDatabaseCode.ts`, and after Restart Now signing in reaches that
   database. An email that wasn't invited is told to ask for an invite. Remove brings it back to
   signed out.
5. `bun tauri dev` and a hand-made build: About says "Local build <hash>" and nothing offers an update.
6. A release build (next tag): About shows the version and updates from releases as before.
7. After the 12th dev build, the files of the oldest are gone from the entry.
8. On Windows, with the released Polarity installed and signed in, install the dev build: both are in
   the Start menu ("Polarity" and "Polarity Dev"), the dev window's title says "Polarity Dev", the dev
   build starts empty and signed out, and the released app's settings and sign-in are unchanged.
   Each updates only from its own line. A `polarity://title/movie/tt0000000` link opens the released
   app, the same link with `polarity-dev://` the dev build; starting either a second time brings its
   own window forward. Uninstalling the dev build leaves the released app as it was.
9. Platform-first names (the first dev build after #356 reaches `dev`, build 5 still kept): the
   entry's files run `latest.json`, then each platform's installers by build, then `Sources-…`,
   `Updates-Dev-<NNNN>.json` and `latest-dev.<N>.json`; build 5's `.sig` files are gone. The notes
   show Downloads for the new build by platform and build 5 in the Earlier builds table, its links
   working. Build 5 offers the new build and updates to it; in build 5, Earlier builds → Install this
   build works on the new build. In the new build, Install this build on build 5 works (its old feed
   name). Checked here: names, order, what's uploaded and removed, notes and feeds
   (`tests/devChannel.test.ts`, and a publish run against build 5's asset list with a stand-in `gh`).

## Crop modes (#330)

The player's crop button cycles Fit, Crop black bars, Fill window; checked here only in the
browser build (no mpv: Fit and Fill window) and by tests. Fill window did nothing on Windows
because mpv's `panscan` wasn't on the list of properties the player may set
(`crates/player/src/allow.rs`); it is now. To check on Windows, macOS and Linux with mpv:

1. Play a film with black bars inside the picture (an open film encoded letterboxed in 16:9 works).
   Press the crop button (bottom right, or Z) three times: each press changes the picture (bars
   trimmed; then edges cropped to cover the window; then the whole frame again), and a notice
   names the new mode. The button's tooltip names the current mode and the next one.
2. With a 16:9 video in a narrow or tall window, Fill window crops the sides or top to cover it.
3. Settings → Advanced → Crop shows the mode the button chose; changing it there changes the
   playing video straight away. Look ahead and Check every frame are greyed out on Fit.
4. Updating from a build before #330 with Crop black bars on starts on Crop black bars (with
   Fill on too: Fill window).
5. Phone or tablet: the full-screen button cycles the same way; pinch out fills, pinch in fits.
   TV mode: the controller's crop binding cycles and says the mode.

## Apple TV core (`crates/ffi`, #504)

The core's Swift binding for the Apple TV app (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, "Apple TV"). Checked on the Linux dev machine:
`cargo test -p polar-ffi` (an add-on on a local server: Home's rows, a title page, sources ranked and kept to
http(s) links with only User-Agent/Referer/Origin passed, progress kept across starts, a file that doesn't parse
kept aside, one that can't be read never written over); `cargo clippy` for Linux and, with a stand-in C compiler,
for `aarch64-apple-tvos` and `aarch64-apple-tvos-sim`; `scripts/apple-tv-core.sh` writing `PolarCore.swift`.
Not checked here, for want of a Mac: the static libraries built with Xcode's toolchain, the XCFramework, and the
generated Swift compiled. To check on a Mac with Xcode: `scripts/apple-tv-core.sh` ends with "Wrote
.../PolarCoreFFI.xcframework and .../PolarCore.swift" and `apple-tv/Core` holds both.

The app (`apple-tv/`) was written without a Swift compiler: CI's `apple-tv` job (macOS runner) is the first to build
it, for the simulator, unsigned. Never run. To check, in the tvOS simulator or on an Apple TV (Xcode, your team):
1. Home opens with shelves (Trending Series, New Movies, ...) from Cinemeta (no sign-in yet, so no TMDB key and no
   add-ons). Swiping moves between cards along a shelf and between shelves; the focused card lifts.
2. Click a show: its page has the backdrop, facts, the description, season buttons and the episodes. Menu goes
   back to Home where you were.
3. Click an episode: "No sources" (no add-ons yet) names why. A movie's Play does the same.

## Screens in headless Chromium (T-051)

- How: `bun run dev`, then open `http://localhost:1420/fake.html` in any browser. The
  fake shell (src/fake-main.ts, src/lib/platform/fake) answers every command from made-up titles; nothing is
  fetched and nothing plays. `?theme=black` and other settings go in the query string; TV mode is
  `localStorage.setItem("polar.tvMode", "1")` in the console, then reload.
- Seen and fixed: every desktop screen (home, Series, Movies, Anime, Library, search, a show, a film, the
  player's start-up screen, the profile menu, every Settings page) at 1440×900 in dark and black; the same at
  390×844 as a phone; TV mode at 1920×1080 (home, each tab, a title, its Episodes, search, the menu, Settings,
  the player), plus a library collection, the Calendar, a card's menu and the player's panels. Fixes:
  c395bfb, aa68e5e (Settings on a phone), 314ea46, de8af47, e31623c.
- What Chromium can't stand in for:
  - The app's own windows. Chromium is close to WebView2 (Windows) but not to WebKitGTK (Linux) or WKWebView
    (macOS): look at `backdrop-filter` glass (navbar, menus, the TV menu), `field-sizing` in the Settings
    number boxes (in WebKit the box may be wider), `text-wrap: balance` in captions, `100dvh` on a phone, and
    the custom scrollbars. On each OS, open Settings → Sources and check "Any size" fits its box.
  - Real artwork, logos and long names: the fixtures are flat colours with short titles. Look at a show with a
    long name on a phone (player title, cards) and at title logos on the TV home.
  - Anime: AniList can't be reached from the fake shell, so the Anime screens only showed their error state.
  - Playback: the player only showed its start-up screen with a failure; the playing controls, Up Next, skip
    buttons, subtitles and the options panels over a playing video were not seen.
  - Fonts: Segoe UI and the system fonts of each OS aren't on this machine.
  - Account and Watch Party: the fake shell has no account, so sign-in, profiles, sync notices and the party
    dialogs were not seen at any size. The library collections, Calendar (empty), card menus and the
    player's Sources and Subtitles & Audio panels were.
  - TV on a TV: walked by arrow keys in the browser, not with a remote or a controller, and not at 4K or
    with overscan.
  - Phones: touch scrolling, the on-screen keyboard over Settings fields, notches and the home indicator
    (safe areas are 0 in Chromium).

## Earlier items

- Settings → About → Cache and Credits cards (TMDB logo 12 px under the notice): look only.
- Trailers: Detail/TV backdrop plays IMDb video files only; the trailer dialog prefers TMDB's YouTube id.
- Removed playback path (T-014): `src-tauri` edits checked by reading only; the old saved setting for the
  removed playback server is ignored on load, and `sourceSort: "peers"` falls back to best.
- UI clean-up (T-019 step 1): profile set-up and profile editor forms rise 8 px and fade in again
  (`auth-form-in` had been renamed away in 1215be7, so they appeared without it). Dead CSS removed by
  grep only (no class built at runtime matched); look for any unstyled About/Library/sign-in element.
- Title right-click menu and profile menu: the highlighted row now follows Settings → Appearance → Accent
  (was the OS accent via `AccentColor`); check the text stays readable on a yellow/teal accent.
- Token pass (T-019 step 2): every replaced literal resolves to the same value (checked by substituting the
  tokens back and diffing all CSS). Only with Windows "high contrast"/`prefers-contrast: more` on: two
  borders that used the hairline colour as a literal (a sign-in form border in `account.css` and a row
  border in the player's options panel) now strengthen with the other hairlines.
- Search fields (T-019 step 3, `SearchField`): the boxes are the same rules under new classes (checked by
  reading). Changed on purpose: every field shows the app's round clear button once it has text (new in
  Settings → Shortcuts, the anime episode search and the source-filter searches; the episode search loses
  the system's own clear "x"), and Escape first empties a field with text before it closes the sheet or
  overlay around it (new in Marketplace, Anime → Browse, the episode and source-filter searches). Check
  the clear button fits in the small source-filter field (9.5 rem wide).
- Primitives Skeleton, Toast, Menu, Popover (T-019 step 3): same rules under new class names (built CSS
  compared). Worth a glance: the controller and update toasts, the title right-click menu with its playlist
  submenu, the download menu, the profile menu and the navbar's "More". Open question for the owner's eye:
  the playlist popover (dark glass) and the source-filter popover (frosted, like the season list) still
  draw different surfaces; say whether they should become one.
- Escape (T-019 step 3, `lib/ui/dismiss.ts`): sheets and the trailer close on Escape through one stack now.
  Before, a sheet closed before anything inside it saw the key, so the "Escape empties the field first"
  above did not work in the episode and source-filter searches; now it should. Check, with a sources sheet
  open: Escape with the Filters popover open closes only the popover; with text in a source-filter search
  it clears the text; a second Escape closes the sheet; a third goes Back. Same for the trailer over a page.
- Poster grids (T-019 step 4, `PosterGrid`): Movies, Series and Anime → Browse used to ask for the next
  page only once the end of the grid was on screen, though the code meant 1200 px before it (the margin was
  measured from the window, and the page scrolls in its own box, which clips it). It now counts from that
  box, so the next page should arrive before you reach the bottom: scroll Movies → Trending quickly and the
  skeleton row should rarely be seen. Library grids are the same rules (built CSS compared).
- Title cards (T-019 step 4, `components/title/Card.tsx`): the poster, landscape, anime, Continue Watching and
  Library download cards are one component with the same elements and classes as before. Changes on purpose:
  art that fails to load is now hidden on every card (only posters did that before; elsewhere WebKit may
  have drawn a broken-image mark), and a download whose thumbnail fails shows the grey still placeholder.
  Check: Home's shelves and Continue Watching (resume button, Enter on a focused card opens the page),
  Anime's shelves with a manga in a franchise (badge, tooltip), Library → Downloads shelf, hidden captions
  in Settings → Browsing.
- Add to playlist (T-019 step 4, `components/title/PlaylistChecklist.tsx`): the card menu's Playlists submenu,
  the detail page's playlist popover and TV's playlist panel now share one list. Check in each: tick and
  untick a playlist (counts change), New Playlist (desktop menu: made at once as "New Playlist", "New
  Playlist 2", ...; popover: asks a name, Esc closes the form only; TV: on-screen keyboard). Changed on
  purpose: when the popover closes with the name form open, the form stays during the closing fade.
- Anime page split (T-019 step 4, `components/anime/`, 440eff9): no change meant; same elements and classes,
  the play model moved to `lib/anime/episodes.ts` with tests. Check on an airing show with several seasons
  (season tabs, next-episode line, Play label resumes where you left off, filler switch, list layout "Show
  all", episode search on a 40+ episode show), a film, and the Details section next to a show's Details tab
  (Story, Tags, Watch Officially, Elsewhere, the facts column beside them).
- Focus in sheets and the trailer (T-019, `lib/ui/layer.ts`): a sources or Filters sheet and the trailer now take
  focus when they open, keep Tab inside, and give focus back when they close. Check with the keyboard: open
  Sources from a show's Play button with Enter, press Tab several times (focus stays in the sheet and wraps),
  Shift+Tab from the first control goes to the last, Escape closes it and focus is on the Play button again;
  open the source Filters popover inside the sheet and Tab there (the popover should behave as before); the
  same with the trailer (Tab stays on its buttons; inside the YouTube player Tab is YouTube's own). No focus
  ring should appear on the sheet or trailer box itself.
- Settings from one schema (T-019 step 5, `lib/settings/schema.ts`): about 35 rows on desktop and every
  row in TV settings are now drawn from it. Desktop should look and behave as before; check the Playback,
  Sources, Browsing, Anime, Controls & TV and Controller pages (titles, captions, dropdown choices, the
  Countdown and Sound volume sliders, (since #330: Crop leaves out Crop black bars without mpv), a click when Interface sounds
  turns on). Changed on purpose: Highest quality also offers 1440p; desktop and TV share choices. On TV,
  check: Mature Anime has Show / Blur posters / Hide; Highest Quality adds 480p; Seek Step goes 1, 5, 10 ...
  120 (and keeps a value like 7 set on desktop); Sound Volume 5%, 10%, 20% ... 100%; choice names now read as
  on desktop ("Best match", "Out of ten (8.6)", "Default" audio); changing a Sources row refreshes the source
  list. Settings search: "with sound", "filler", "marketplace" now lead to a row (each used to land on the
  page with nothing highlighted).
- One Settings UI (T-019 step 5, M26): the old full-page Settings is gone. On a title with every source hidden
  by filters, "Source Filters" opens the settings window on Sources over the page (it used to replace the
  page); with no sources, "Manage Add-ons" opens it on Add-ons. On TV the same buttons open TV settings, now
  straight on Sources for "Source Filters" (Back goes to the category list); "Manage Add-ons" lands on the
  list as before. Switching from TV to desktop (the TV toggle shortcut) while on TV settings should open the
  settings window on desktop with the previous screen under it, or Home.
- Player options and TV Back (T-019 step 6, `lib/ui/dismiss.ts`, `lib/ui/layer.ts`): the player's full-window
  picker (Speed, Subtitles & Audio, Episodes, Sources, Party) closes on Escape through the shared stack, keeps
  Tab inside, and gives focus back to what had it when it opened. TV's panels and card menu are on the same
  stack (TV's own Back stack is gone). Check on desktop: open Sources with its button, Tab several times (focus
  stays in the picker), Escape closes it and the Sources button has focus again (Space then still plays or
  pauses, nothing reopens); with the source size slider focused, Escape closes the picker; with a filter
  dropdown open, Escape closes only the dropdown. On TV: B over the picker closes it; B in a title's Playlists
  panel goes back to the menu, then the card; Backspace does the same; the back sound plays once each time.
  Changed on purpose: on TV, closing a sources sheet or the trailer with B now also plays the back sound.
- Notes in the player (T-019 step 6): the top note ("That source didn't load. Trying the next best one."), the party's "Waiting for…" pill and its
  activity notes still draw their own pills (flat dark surface), unlike the app's toasts (glass with an edge).
  Say whether they should look like the toasts; nothing changed.
- TV cards (T-019 step 6, `useCardArt`): a TV card whose picture failed showed the title instead for good; now a
  new picture for the same card (a playlist entry that was still loading, better art) is tried again. Check a
  TV playlist rail right after start-up: cards fill in with art, none stays on the plain title unless the
  picture really is missing.
- Account screens on `Button`/`TextField` (T-024): sign in (`size="block"`, `variant="accent"`, `TextField
  look="block"`) and the profile screens' actions (`size="sm"`, `variant="outline"`/`"danger"`) keep their rules
  (checked by reading the cascade). Changed on purpose, to make the account screens one look: the profile
  set-up's name field and Continue button take the sign-in field and button (44 px, pill button with the
  accent, quiet border with a soft ring on focus; were 52 px field with a white focus ring and a 48 px square
  button), and the profile editor's name field takes the same border and focus (keeps its large type). Check
  sign in (both steps, the code step's paste, a wrong code), profile set-up, Manage Profiles, edit, delete.
- Error boundaries (rewrite R1, critique C4): a page, the player and the whole app each show "Something went
  wrong here." with a way out (Reload; Back in the player) instead of a blank window. No test can make a render
  fail here (no DOM in `bun test`). To check: open Movies
  with Genre = Horror and Catalog = Popular after searching "horror" (the old crash, now fixed by
  `lib/net/queryKeys.ts`, so the page must simply work), and for the note itself temporarily add
  `throw new Error("x")` to the top of `screens/Calendar.tsx`'s component, open Calendar: the note shows in
  the page with the nav still working; on TV the note takes the TV look and its Reload must be reachable with
  the controller.
- Saved data that can't be read (rewrite R1, critique C1; `src-tauri` store.rs/downloads.rs, built by reading
  only): only a missing `polar.json`/`downloads.json` starts fresh now. Any other read error leaves the file
  alone for the session (nothing is saved over it; actions that save report "could not save") and a toast says
  so with the reason; a damaged file is copied aside as before, and if that copy fails nothing is saved
  either. The decision is `polar_library::opened` (tested). To check: quit Polarity, make `polar.json` in the app
  data folder unreadable (`chmod 000 polar.json` on Linux/macOS; on Windows deny Read in its Security tab),
  start Polarity: the toast shows, adding a title fails, and after quitting and restoring the permission the
  file still holds the old library. Then put `{` into a copy of the file: a `polar.corrupt-….json` appears
  and the app starts empty.
- Sign-out with unsynced changes (rewrite R1, critique C2): sign-out now pushes every profile of the account
  (not only the active one) for up to 8 s, then counts what is still unpushed; if anything is, nothing is
  dropped and a dialog ("Some changes haven't synced") offers Try Again, Sign Out Anyway and Cancel. Each sync
  round of the active profile also pushes the other profiles' leftovers (a profile left while offline). The
  pushing and counting are `lib/account/spacePush.ts` (tested); the dialog and the wiring are not. Since M12
  (below) sign-out forgets playlists too, so every profile's changed playlists are pushed and counted as well
  (`playlistChanges(space)`, tested); links a server without the `anime_links` table can't take are not counted. To check, signed in with two profiles: in profile A
  add a title to the library, then turn the network off and switch to profile B, play something for a minute,
  then Sign Out (profile menu): the dialog shows a count; Cancel keeps you signed in; turn the network on,
  Try Again signs out; sign back in on another device: both changes are there. Repeat offline and choose Sign
  Out Anyway: you are signed out. The dialog also opens from the "Who's watching?" screen's Sign Out; on TV
  check that the controller can reach its three buttons.
- AniList and ani.zip request budget (rewrite R3, critique M10; `lib/net/limiter.ts`, tested with a fake
  clock): every AniList request now shares one budget (10 at once, then 20 a minute, raised to the limit
  AniList reports in `X-RateLimit-Limit` less 10 if the webview may read that header), ani.zip another (20,
  then 120 a minute). A 429 holds all requests to that host for its Retry-After (at most 60 s for AniList,
  30 s for ani.zip, 60 s/5 s when absent) and is retried once. Every ani.zip lookup now goes through the query
  cache (one request per show, shared by search, AniSkip, Kitsu titles, the stream filter and TV), and a query
  nobody needs any more stops waiting. Neither host is reachable from the dev machine. To check: open Anime,
  then a long franchise (more than ten entries): the seasons row still fills (more slowly past 10 hops: about one
  hop every 3 s while AniList is at 30 a minute); scroll every genre shelf; no "AniList answered 429" error
  appears. In the dev tools' Network tab, opening the same anime twice asks ani.zip once.
- Watch-party message checks (rewrite R3, critique M11; `lib/party/messages.ts`, tested): every broadcast and
  presence entry is parsed before use; malformed ones are dropped silently. A timeline more than 50 versions
  ahead is taken only from the host, so a member who was offline catches up from the host's heartbeat (within
  10 s). Not run against a real room. To check, with two signed-in devices: start a party on one, join by code on
  the other within 8 s; pause, resume, seek and change episode from both sides; turn one device's network off for
  a minute, change things on the other, turn it back on: within about 10 s both show the same state again.
- What a signed-out device keeps (rewrite R3, critique M12): sign-out and account deletion now also remove every
  profile's playlists, its cached synced settings, the remembered last profile and the recent searches (my call:
  they were global and showed the last person's searches to the next). Deleting a profile removes its playlists
  too. A guest's playlists are copied into the first profile with the library (`importLocalPlaylists`, tested).
  The device's own settings, addons, shortcuts and synced preferences are kept aside when a profile is first
  entered and put back at sign-out (`keepDeviceSettings`/`restoreDeviceSettings`, `polar.settingsOwner`; wiring
  untested). Signed in when updating to this version: no device copy exists yet, so the first sign-out leaves
  the profile's settings in place, as before. To check: as a guest, make a playlist and set the subtitle size
  and an addon; sign up: the profile has the playlist and those settings; change subtitle size and remove the
  addon; sign out: the guest's subtitle size and addon are back, the playlist list is the guest's, the search
  box shows no recent searches, and `localStorage` (devtools) has no `polar.playlists.<profile id>` or
  `polar.settingsSync.<profile id>` keys.
- Rust/TS field-name contract (rewrite R3, critique M5): `contract/addon.json` and `contract/library.json` were
  written by the crates' own tests; `contract/app.json` was written by hand from `src-tauri`'s types, and its test
  (`src-tauri/src/contract.rs`, a child of `commands.rs`) has never compiled. To check: `cargo test -p polar`
  on a desktop (CI's `cargo test --workspace` runs it). If it fails, it prints what `contract/app.json` should
  read: paste that in, then run `bun run test`; a failing `tests/contract.test.ts` names the TS type to fix in
  `src/lib/types.ts` (and `src/lib/contract.ts`).
- Command errors as `{ code, message }` (rewrite R3, critique L1; `src-tauri` built by reading only): every
  failure the app shows should still read as a sentence, never `[object Object]`. To check: install an addon from
  a URL that doesn't exist (Settings → Addons: the message names the network problem); open a title whose addon
  is gone; start a download of a source that plays in a browser ("can't be downloaded"); play a source that answers
  404 (the loading screen says `Failed at the source's server`) and, with mpv missing from its folder, any source
  (`Failed at the player`). Signed in with 5 profiles, adding a sixth says "An account can have up to 5 profiles."
- Account limits (#110; supabase/migrations/20261107000000_account_limits.sql, tested in PGlite:
  tests/sql/accountLimits.test.ts). Not run on a real project. To check on a copy (docs/supabase-storage.md
  §7, §8): apply the migration, run `supabase/checks/account_limits.sql` (every count 0, then the
  validations go through) and `supabase/admin/account_usage.sql`; sign in and sync as usual (nothing
  changes below the caps). The "Your account is full" toast (`AccountFullToast`) and syncing the other
  kinds while one is full are tested in parts (spacePush, dbError), not in the running app.
- CAPTCHA on sign-in (#110; `lib/account/captcha.ts`, `screens/account/Captcha.tsx`): never shown, since
  no site key exists yet. Unverified: whether Turnstile's widget loads and passes in the app's web view
  on each platform (pages come from `tauri://localhost` on macOS, Linux and iOS and
  `http://tauri.localhost` on Windows and Android; the CSP allows `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`
  as script and frame), and whether Supabase also asks for a CAPTCHA when the code is entered (the app
  sends one only with the request for a code). To check, on each platform with a build carrying
  `VITE_CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` and CAPTCHA on in a test project: ask for a code: the check shows under the
  button, and once passed the code is sent; enter the code: signed in. With CAPTCHA off: no check shows.
- `polar.json` renamed `polarity.json` (#40; `polar_library::moved::take_over_or_keep`, tested on Linux): at
  the first start of this version the file is copied to `polarity.json` (owner-only on Linux and macOS), then
  the old one renamed `polar.json.moved`. If the copy can't be made, `polar.json` stays in use and the next start
  tries again. The log (`polar.log`) and the `app.getpolar.desktop` folders keep their names. To check on each
  desktop: with a library and settings from the previous version, start this one: everything is there, the app
  data folder has `polarity.json` and `polar.json.moved` and no `polar.json`; change a setting, quit, start
  again: still changed. An earlier version started after this one finds no `polar.json` and starts empty
  (rename `polar.json.moved` back to go back).
- Add-ons and API keys per profile on a device (#80, #429; `startProfile`, `setupSources`, `copySetup` in
  `lib/account/settingsSync.ts`, tested with the mocked store). Settings → Account → "Share add-ons and keys":
  Not shared, Between this account's profiles (the default; the old On and installs from before #80), With every
  account on this device. Not run signed in. To check: as a guest add a TMDB key and an add-on; sign in to account
  1 and make profile A: no key, no add-on (the guest isn't a profile of the account), and the offer lists Guest; add
  a key of A's own. Make profile B of account 1: it starts with A's key. Sign out, sign in to account 2: none of
  account 1's. Back to account 1 with a new profile C after account 2: A's (or B's) set, none of account 2's. With
  Not shared, a new profile starts empty; with every account, it starts with whatever was here.
- AniList requests by priority, rows kept on the device (#109; `lib/net/limiter.ts`, `lib/net/deviceCache.ts`,
  tested with a fake clock and a fake AniList). Not run against AniList. To check, with devtools' Network filtered to
  `anilist`: scroll the Anime page to the genre rows; rows on screen fill within a few seconds even while AniList
  answers `X-RateLimit-Limit: 30`, and then each row is one request. Open a card while rows are still loading: its
  page doesn't wait behind them. After a 429, loading shelves say "AniList is busy, loading…". Quit and start again:
  the Anime page draws its rows at once. Settings → About → Cache → Clear empties them.
- Watch party menu (#156; `components/party/PartyMenu.tsx`, the host's rules in `lib/party/room.ts`). Tested on
  simulated members (tests/partyMenu.test.ts): remove, make host, lock, approve joins, host-only control, wait
  for everyone, end party, the host leaving, Disconnected, "behind", mute; the menu itself in tests/dom. Not run
  against a real room or on TV. There's no server of our own: the rules hold because every member's app keeps
  them, and a member removed keeps a code it can join again with as someone new unless the party is locked.
  To check, with three signed-in devices (A starts, B and C join):
  1. On A away from the player, click the faces in the top bar: what's playing, the members with their status,
     the code, Go to the Current Stream (opens the player in step), Mute party sounds, Leave Party, and the
     host controls. Leave B's player: A shows B as Away; pull B's network: Disconnected, then gone.
  2. A turns on Approve joins; C joins: C's dialog says it's waiting, A's faces get a dot, A lets C in.
     Again with Decline: C is told the host didn't let it in.
  3. A turns on Lock party: a new join is told the party is locked; unlocking lets it in.
  4. A turns on Only I control playback: B's pause, seek or next episode doesn't change the room (B gets a note,
     its player goes back); A's do.
  5. A makes B host: within a couple of seconds both show B as Host and only B has the host controls.
     B removes C: C sees "The host removed you from the watch party." B ends the party: A sees it ended.
  6. B hosts and leaves: the next member becomes host and everyone gets a note.
  7. TV mode: the menu (side menu → Watch Party) works with the remote; the player's Watch Party panel has the
     same parts.

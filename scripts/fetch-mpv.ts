// Puts the mpv.exe the Windows app bundles into src-tauri/vendor/mpv (player.rs looks there first,
// tauri.windows.conf.json bundles it with its licence texts) and the exact sources it was built
// from into src-tauri/vendor/mpv-sources (release.ts attaches them to the release).
//
// Both come from the workflow windows-mpv.yml (scripts/windows-mpv.sh), which builds them once per
// version of that script and scripts/windows-mpv.lock and keeps them as the artifact
// windows-mpv-<version> (~545 MB: most of it is the source archive), plus windows-mpv-bin-<version>
// with only the player and its licence texts. Downloaded here with the GitHub CLI (gh, signed in),
// with its size and progress shown. Or from a build of your own: --from <its out folder>. No-op when
// vendor/mpv already holds this version, and off Windows (macOS bundles libmpv with
// scripts/bundle-libmpv.ts).
//
// --dev (tauri dev, #186): a build already in vendor/mpv will do, even an older one, as long as it
// has every file tauri.windows.conf.json bundles (the Rust build fails without them). Otherwise only
// the player is fetched, not the source archive. Builds and releases still pin the version and take both.
// Without CI's copy (gh missing or signed out, the artifact expired), a dev run takes the player the
// newest release attaches (Tools-Polarity-<version>-Windows-x64-mpv.zip, public, no sign-in), even an older build.

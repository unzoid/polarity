 *   3. the stream this video was last played with (resume = same file), only when it was saved for this
 *      title and episode and the add-ons still offer it for this episode, or it's the episode's download
 *      (#394: never a source the Sources list couldn't offer), else
 *   4. the top-ranked streams, in order.
 * The decision is frozen once made — saving progress mid-playback must never
 * re-trigger source selection. `next()` falls through after a playback error.
 * Each decision and attempt is written to `log` (the loading screen's steps).
 * A torrent source is opened by the backend's engine, whose steps are logged
 * too (peer counts until `started()` says the picture is up), and closed when
 * the player goes or falls through to the next source. The first torrent on a
 * device waits for the user's Play or Cancel in a notice first (Prefs.torrentNotice).
 * On mobile data with Prefs.torrentMobileData off, torrents are passed over without
 * being opened (#207); the engine stopping while the app was away fails the source for good.
 * Each try of a ranked source, and each that fails to open, is kept for Best Match
 * (sourceHistory.ts); the player records whether it started and played through.

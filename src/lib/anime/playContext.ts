/**
 * What the player needs to know about an anime episode that its video id
 * doesn't say: the episode's number in its anime entry (AniList's,
 * MyAnimeList's and Kitsu's numbering, where an IMDb id says season and
 * episode), that entry's MAL and Kitsu ids, and which episodes are filler.
 * The anime page works this out when it lines the episodes up (AnimeDetail's
 * usePlayback) and leaves it here, kept in localStorage, so playing from
 * Continue Watching, TV mode or after a restart has it too.
 *
 * One IMDb show is often several anime entries (seasons, split cours), each
 * with its own Kitsu and MAL ids and its own numbering, so the ids are kept
 * per episode: opening one entry's page doesn't change what another's
 * episodes are asked by.
 *
 * Uses: AniSkip asks by MAL id and number (aniskip.ts); stream addons are
 * also asked for the Kitsu id of an IMDb-numbered episode (`kitsu:48036:5`,
 * which many anime addons index by; api.streams), and files numbered from
 * the start of the show count as the episode; the player's "skip filler"
 * autoplay.
 *
 * Kept per title (the canonical id, docs/anime-identity.md), the titles
 * looked at most recently first; at most MAX_TITLES.

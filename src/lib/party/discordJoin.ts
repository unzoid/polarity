/**
 * Joining a watch party from someone's Discord profile (#153, #154, #357).
 *
 * Discord's Join hands over a join token (the activity's join secret), never the party code:
 * 16 random bytes, then the fingerprint of a key pair the desk made for that
 * token. A token is handed out for JOIN_TOKEN_MS, after which a new one
 * replaces it (the previous one still answers for another JOIN_TOKEN_MS, so a
 * Join someone pressed just before the change still works). The member whose
 * profile it is runs a desk: it listens on a channel named after a hash of
 * each live token, and a joiner who has the token asks there.
 *
 * - "Anyone who sees it": the desk lets the joiner in at once.
 * - "Ask me": the member sees "<name> wants to join" and allows or declines.
 * - A locked room (#156) turns everyone away; once in, the room's own rules
 *   (approving joins, removing members) apply as to anyone with the code.
 *
 * Anyone who has the token can listen and speak on its channel. So every
 * answer to a joiner (the code, a refusal, "seen") is sealed with a key only
 * the two of them share (ECDH: the joiner's one-time key pair and the token's;
 * AES-GCM), and the joiner only takes an answer from the key the token's
 * fingerprint names: someone else with the token can't hand a joiner the code
 * of another party, turn them away or keep them waiting.
 * Messages are parsed like the room's (messages.ts): anything else is dropped.
 * Pure apart from its deps, so tests run it against a simulated channel
 * (tests/discordJoin.test.ts).

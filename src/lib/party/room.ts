/**
 * A watch-party room, as one member sees it. Built by `createPartyRoom` so
 * the app runs one (party.ts) and tests run several against a simulated
 * server and clock (tests/partySync.test.ts, tests/partyMenu.test.ts).
 *
 * - The timeline is last-action-wins, ordered by (version, author), so two
 *   people pressing pause at once still end on the same state everywhere.
 * - No shared clock: each message carries its sender's one-way latency
 *   (half the round trip of its own echo) and the receiver adds its own, so
 *   positions are extrapolated to "now" without trusting anyone's system time.
 * - The host (first to have joined, or whoever it handed the role to) holds
 *   the room while anyone is loading (and, if the room says so, while anyone
 *   stalls mid-video, #238), answers newcomers and sets the room's rules
 *   (#156): locked, who controls playback, waiting, approving joins, who's
 *   been removed. Leaving hands the role to the next in line.
 * - A joiner knocks first: it isn't shown or listened to until the host lets
 *   it in, which the host does at once unless the room is locked or asks it
 *   to approve joins. There's no server of our own, so the rules hold because
 *   every member's app keeps them (see messages.ts).
 * - Leaving the player isn't leaving the room: a member who's browsing is
 *   "away" (not waited for), on every screen. Only Leave Party leaves, and it
 *   says so to the room ("bye"), so nobody has to guess from presence.
 * - Presence can lag or drop an update. Each member numbers its own entries
 *   (`seq`), shows itself as it knows it is, and re-sends its entry when the
 *   room's copy stays out of date. A member missing from presence without a
 *   "bye" is kept for a moment (as Disconnected) before being shown as gone,
 *   so a blip on the server never splits the room.
 * - Presence isn't the only sign of life (#203): everyone pings every few
 *   seconds, so a member heard from lately is shown as connected whatever
 *   presence says, and is asked to send its entry again until presence agrees.
 *   A member whose own pings stop coming back reconnects by itself.
 * - Presence updates are rationed (#227): the server closes the channel of a
 *   client that sends more than 5 in 30 s, and a closed channel still sends
 *   (broadcasts fall back to REST) but hears nothing. A change of status waits
 *   a moment for the next, so a burst goes as one update, and no more than
 *   PRESENCE_MAX go out per PRESENCE_WINDOW_MS, the entry after each join
 *   included. A channel the server closes anyway is opened again at once.
 * - The host has the last word on the timeline: a member's change the host
 *   refuses (it doesn't count the member as in the room) is answered with the
 *   host's, marked as refusing it, and the member goes back to the host's.
 * - Every device keeps a party log (log.ts) for "Copy party log".
